"Hey Bruins! Here's a fresh megathread for all questions and inquires from future or incoming students. To the current students who have been regularly answering questions, thanks for being so helpful!  Transfers and freshmen: please use this megathread or search function before asking questions. Your question may have already been answered. Future questions may be redirected here.  For reference, you can find the prior discussion [here](https://redd.it/g6c2ov)  Thanks!",How hard is CS 31 in the fall with a weak CS background?   It's between Physics 1A and CS31 and I'm not sure on what to take as the Physics 1A professor have some negative reviews :/,"I would not recommend CS 31 in fall if you're not a CS major and have weak experience. Instead of taking Physics, you can take a second GE or a second math class, since math of comp requires a lot of math classes.",I can‚Äôt travel to the US due to covid. Is there anyway I can defer this year?,"If you're a new freshman on transfer, no unless you join the military.","When should I start looking for/buying textbooks for classes? Is it like we need the textbooks by the first day of classes, or are we given the list of materials on the first day and are expected to have it by next class (just one example)?","Definitely depends on the class. I've never really had any problems waiting until the first day of classes, where you'll find out whether the textbook is actually required or not. Sometimes there's also other online resources you're required to purchase for a class (Kudu, Mastering Physics, etc.).  As soon as the syllabus for a class is uploaded (could be anywhere from a few weeks to a day before class starts), I would recommend you look at what materials it lists and start looking into where you could get them. PDFs of most textbooks can typically be found online if you know where to look.",How do we find out about clubs as activities? Is there like a club day or something where clubs come to advertise themselves?,"For right now (cause things can‚Äôt be in person), they‚Äôre holding a virtual club fair on your first day of orientation from 7-9pm. There‚Äôs also this website: https://oncampus.us where you can search up clubs by interest, availability, etc., the website will also list the application process to the club if the club page is updated!","hi! im an incoming 1st yr bioengineering major and ik i'll get more info at my orientation but im trying to figure out a possible first quarter schedule. Right now i'm thinking intro to bioengineering, calc 31b, chem 20a, and i'm not sure for the 4th class. i checked an example 4 yr plan for bioengineering majors which is where i got these classes, but the 4th slot was engl 3 and im pretty sure i test out with my 4 on ap lang so i was wondering if i really do test out and should i take a diff engl class or something else entirely?",Bioengineers who have tested out of Eng Comp generally take a GE! I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking anything but a GE or English class in fall.,Don't take another English or writing 2 class. A 4 tests you out. You should choose a GE.,I‚Äôm not the strongest at math and I am taking math 31AL for the fall quarter. Is there any way to prepare for the class (textbooks or workbooks)?,What are the general consensus on clusters? Are they worth the extra time and work to knock out a few more requirements?,"Most people are against them, but tbh if it fits you and you pick the right one, it‚Äôs such a lifesaver. I picked the food cluster and it knocked out a TON of my requirements (which I personally did not want to fulfill over the course of a year with GEs) while being an easy A+ (like... idk exactly how many people but it should be close to at the very least half the class that finished with an A+). I should mention that idk if it‚Äôll still be that easy. If you like the subject it‚Äôs awesome. If not, and if it‚Äôs a difficult cluster, it might be hell. It‚Äôs a bit of a leap of faith. A lot of people prefer the GE route because it can provide a lot of variety.  One exception: if you‚Äôre in the honors college you absolutely should do a cluster, they knock out 2 years worth of honors credit or something insane like that.","Yeah from the info I have gathered from people, it is usually a better and more interesting route to take individuals GE classes. Also, people say you should be super interested in the topic if you‚Äôre going to take the cluster. For me, when I looked up the GE classes that lined up with my major, it just didn‚Äôt make sense to take a cluster. I would have had to take other GE classes even if I had done the cluster. So, just make sure you‚Äôre interested and that it will actually cover some units for you.",Most people on this subreddit hate them lol. They're time-inflexible and take care of GEs with classes that are much harder than the average class chosen for a GE.,Quick question is on campus parking currently free due to covid? Was thinking about coming to visit the campus,"Parking on campus isn't free, but there's plenty of free parking around the apartment area behind Gayley (good number of spots open rn)",lol no. The parking lot itself could be destroyed and they will still charge for it. $15 (?) parking for the day I believe.,Ok thanks! I heard parking at UCI was free until Sept 1st so was just curious haha,"My new student orientation starts on Wednesday, and I have tried multiple times to set up a UCLA zoom account, but every time it gives me the error message ‚Äúsomething went wrong while you tried signing in with SSO.‚Äù Is anyone else having this problem or know how to fix?","When is the best/worst time for discussions? Let‚Äôs say you have a class MWF 11:30-12:30. Would the best time be before the first section on Monday, after the last on Friday, or somewhere inbetween?   What if you have a singular time slot (let‚Äôs say W 1:00-2:15). Would the best time be before 1:00, after 2:15, etc.? What‚Äôs the general consensus on these?","Whenever works best for you!! As the other commenter said, if the TA is already up then most people will do some searching and pick one that seems to be liked (tbh most of the time there‚Äôs no info on any of them, but sometimes it can save you).   More importantly, pick a time you can actually function at. All discussions should cover the same material so the particular day or time does not have a set preference. It comes down to whenever you feel like you‚Äôll be most productive.","there isn't one! most people will try to pick based on TAs (if you know them or know people who know them) or on what time works for them (ie: does not conflict with other classes, not at 8 AM, not at 6 PM).",and check out the @ uclaclassof2024 insta page!!!,"Hi, I need some opinions about my classes. I'm an incoming freshman majoring in ChemE and for my Fall, I've decided to take the 4 typical ChemE freshman classes: Math 31A, Chem 20A, ChemEng 10, and EngComp 3. I've heard that at UCLA, the workload of taking 4 classes is quite heavy but, I'm intrigued to take AOS 1. I'm still unsure about it since a lot of people on this subreddit emphasized the 4-class limit but, seeing that ChemEng 10 is only 1 unit, I wonder how adding AOS 1 to my class plan affects my course load.","Being a GE science class, AOS 1 won't be at all difficult compared to engineering classes. I took the somewhat similar course AOS 3, found it extremely interesting, and ended up adding the AOS minor.","The Engineering 10 classes are fairly easy with not much work since they are only 1 unit. That being said, taking 17 units your first quarter is not advised and not really necessary. You can always take if another time, and it‚Äôs better to focus on the weeder classes for your major to adjust before taking on larger course loads .","Well 13 units is actually a really doable workload. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking AOS 1 your first quarter because adjusting to a 10-week system, along with transitioning to college takes some getting used to. You can always just take it the quarter after as you still have a long time in a college and there‚Äôs no need to rush.","NSO Activities Fair (hosted by ASUCLA, and I think we need to join before signing up) will happen twice: on  Monday, August 17th and Saturday, September 12th.  Does it matter which we go to?  Also, do we need to do anything to prep for it?  Has anyone experienced this in-person? I guess it is virtual for the first time this year, not sure what to expect.","Hello, I am a returning second year but have a question about Work Study, since this is my first year being rewarded it. I have yet to accept the award since I am waiting on Grant updates, but I wanted to know when do job postings start coming up for the school year? I only see those for the Summer terms. I am interested in a certain job position but it currently only is listed for the Summer term, and wanted to know if it'd be worth emailing the department and asking if the position would be available for the upcoming school year, starting Fall.","Not too sure how things will go this year but last year I was able to get a job on campus like a week or two before class started and it was fairly easy too. They give jobs out like candy, and they pay well IMO",Does anyone know when we are getting our bruincards?,i read that we won‚Äôt receive our ‚Äúroom key‚Äù until after we get tested for covid at the ashe center. Since we need our bruincard to open our dorms ig theyre implying we wont get them until move in. Idk about students who aren‚Äôt loving on campus,"In the mail, sometime this summer. They said it would be 2 weeks after your orientation but it's almost been 3 and I still haven't gotten it. ü§∑","Hope yours arrives soon! You've still got time before the quarter starts!  As for myself, I'm hoping it won't be a problem if we don't have a Bruincard when the quarter starts (my orientation date is in mid september...ahaha...)","I mean, what are we gonna swipe for at home lol",you have a good point lol!,i'm an econ major. i took the math placement test and got into 31A. but i have absolutely no idea how that happened because i'm avg at math at best and also don't like the subject that much. would you recommend taking math 31AL instead and then 31B the next quarter (because a junior told me that's allowed and taking 31AL fulfils the same requirement as 31A)?  she said it's easier and a gpa booster and i'm considering it. thanks!,You can't take 31AL after being placed in 31A.,wait really why not? i haven't enrolled yet. plus i'm not sure my result shows on the class planner because it still mentions the placement test prerequisite.,"You can take Math 31 AL if you want to. That junior was right, it does fulfill the same requirement as 31A. In order to enroll in Math 31AL you had to meet the minimum test result (which you did), so you are allowed to enroll in 31AL. The result will not show in your class planner because both systems are not connected.  More info:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/8v59ou/math\_31al\_vs\_math\_31a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/8v59ou/math_31al_vs_math_31a/)  [https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/diag-placement](https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/diag-placement)",Wouldn't op need to ask for a PTE number since it's enforced that your score be <80%?,"Yeah if there are no seats available, but the enforced requisite is that they don't want people with a 31A score to go to 31AL. If op does not feel adequately prepared for Math31A there is no reason that he should take it. Same as with the chemistry diagnostic test, if you don't feel prepared for the class recommended then you are free to take a class below that. Op shows that he is capable of enrolling in 31A, other option would be to retake the placement exam and miss 7 questions so that he ""places"" in 31AL.","An enforced requisite for 31AL is a score of between 60 and 80% on the test. Since you placed in 31A, your score must have been >80%","Are spots for clusters saved for every orientation date like regular classes are? My orientation is next week and when I was looking at classes, it said the 60s one was full and over enrolled. Is there a chance I could still get in?",Ya more seats will open up for you. I had orientation last week and I actually enrolled in the 60s cluster. Hopefully we can be classmates!,"It says seats are held, so I assume so.","on the day of new student orientation, when is the earliest you allowed to enroll in classes? like 8am or when you meet your nsa?","For transfers, I believe enrollment is at the end of the day.",I think transfer students enroll at a different time tho since their orientation is only one day and ours is three :/,transfers enroll at 7 pm,"1. I know that the dorms are now restricted to 1 person per room but I'm curious how many actual rooms are there per floor? I'm in ""sproul landing / cove"" for the record.  2. Bonus question; are the floors co-ed?",1. I think there‚Äôs like 20 something rooms per floor in SLC??? You can look up the floor plan for each floor tho on UCLA‚Äôs housing website to count how many there actually are. 2. Yes but guys and girls and separated in separate wings of the building. You can access either wing it‚Äôs just split in the middle,>guys and girls and separated in separate wings of the building  Is this new this year? Normally nearly every floor is co-ed,You know what i actually think you might be right. I think I just assumed that since the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs community restrooms are in separate wings of the buildings that guys and girls are separated but i guess not. Sorry for spreading misinformation guys.,"You also might be right, especially this year if they change stuff to reduce the number of people passing in the hallways. [Here's the layout of a typical deluxe hall floor](https://imgur.com/uETZx40)  It does look like some of the deluxe hall floors (looks like mostly floor 2) are half-size and only have one bathroom so those are definitely single-gender floors",does the new student orientation restrict you to enrolling in only 3 classes even if you have an excess units petition?,"No, but your NSA will forcibly drop you from excess classes.",so when the orientation is finished they check that you are only enrolled in 3 classes? even if i have a petition to take over the limit?,"Yes. But how would you petition for excess units? You would normally need to be in good academic standing, which requires at least a 2.0 GPA. Since you're a new student, you would have no GPA.",i took 16 units for this summer session,Ya idk how you would petition for excess units. My NSA specifically told us during my orientation session that incoming freshman can‚Äôt petition for more units cause we don‚Äôt have an established UC GPA like the previous user said. Your NSA will limit you to enroll in only three classes (usually two major reqs and a GE) and they will drop you if you enroll in more than those core classes. You can enroll in a fiat lux as a fourth class if you want but the NSAs only allow that cause those classes are easy seminars worth only one unit.,i‚Äôm a new transfer and i took summer courses at ucla,"Oh, then idk if you can petition. Your transfer GPA doesn't matter anymore, but your UC GPA from your classes might make you eligible. However, you would have to add your classes after 9/22 since they want to ensure that all incoming students are able to take classes they need.",You would have to petition after finishing the classes though.,"Ohhhhh you see that makes a big difference sorry I assumed you were a freshman. Honestly I have no clue now, did you already petition for the extra units and were granted them? Cause if so your NSA should have that on record during your orientation and they will allow you to enroll up to your limit cap. Again tho this is just speculation, they still might not allow you to enroll in more than three classes since you‚Äôre still technically a new student. When your NSA sends you their introduction email, I would email them back and ask about this",question: is it like there‚Äôs one nsa officer helping you register? or is the nsa officer watching over a bunch of students,There‚Äôs one NSA who facilitates a group of about 10 students including you. I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll get one on one appointments with your NSA in the transfer orientation because it‚Äôs only one day but I know freshman got one on ones on day 2 of our orientation. I assume you would still get a one on one tho sometime during the day because that‚Äôs when the nsa recommends what classes you specifically should take plus it‚Äôs when they ask you about any concerns you may have. Sorry I‚Äôm not really the person to ask about the details for transfer orientation :(,"Things could be completely different, but last year at transfer orientation we did get one on one time with our NSA. We sat down and worked out what classes I would enroll in. About an hour or two later we actually enrolled. He did check that I was enrolled in 2 major classes and a great with no finals on the same day.   When my second pass came around I basically changed my whole schedule. I even took two classes with a same day final. (It was the same professor so I talked to her before enrolling in the second class. She thought it would be fine and it totally was.)",[deleted],"Depends on the class. The math class I'm taking now is mostly the TA giving us practice problems to do. A humanities discussion, I would expect, would be more of a discussion about the material.",[deleted],"Correct, that doesn't come into play until Late Junior/ Senior year.",[deleted],"Oh lmao I didn't notice you were the same person lol. Then, you can't take the last few units before graduation (I think it depends on your college) at another university/cc. You also have a max number you can take during summer of these units, but that doesn't apply to you as you plan to graduate by Spring.",I sent my ap scores around June 20th and it still says not received on myucla portal. Does anyone know who I should call to get like an update because my orientation is soon and I need my ap scores to skip a certain class.‚Äô,"Heyoooo. If you‚Äôre really concerned call the admissions office but my guess is things are just backed up because of COVID. Odds are they received your scores they just haven‚Äôt updated it yet. You can also log back into your collegeboard account to see if the scores were received by UCLA. In terms of orientation don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt get through to admissions or it‚Äôs not updated beforehand. Your NSA will send you an academic profile to fill out the day before your first day of orientation where you can list all your sat, act, ib, and ap tests scores, as well as any dual enrollment classes you may have taken. Your NSA can then use this information to manually update your DAR so you won‚Äôt be restricted in what classes you want to enroll in, so long as you actually have the credit to skip out of certain classes.","Hi, i have a similar concern to the original commentator. So this past summer i took calc bc at my local cc, equivalent to math 31A and 31B. However, my orientation is coming up and ucla still has not receieved my transcript, so will my NSA be able to clear me of these courses which will allow me to take physics 1A and math 32A? I have the unofficial transcript on hand. Thank you","Ya you‚Äôll be fine. Like I said, odds are UCLA has received your official documentation they just haven‚Äôt updated your profile yet. Back when I sent my transcript, I was notified that UCLA received the official electronic copy the same day my CC sent it for my dual enrollment class but my admissions page on myucla wasn‚Äôt updated to reflect that until about 2-3 weeks after. This was the same with my high school transcript. Once your NSA receives your academic profile (which they will ask you to fill out in their introduction email the day before your orientation session starts) they will manually update anything that may not already be reflected on your myucla admissions page. They will also update your DAR like I said so you won‚Äôt be restricted to enroll in the classes you want so long as you have credit for the pre reqs. Just have patience though and don‚Äôt be so worried about it. Your DAR will most likely be updated on the second day of orientation (the day before you enroll in classes) so it won‚Äôt have accurate information about what credits you have as of right now.",Thank you! My cc only senda physical transcripts so im not sure if ucla has received my transcript or not :/. Is the cc transcript status uploaded below the high school transcript in admission home? Did ucla update your admission home amd DARs before your orientation? Thanks,"If you‚Äôre unsure whether or not UCLA has received your transcript you could always try calling the admissions office to see. And ya, the CC transcript status is updated on your admissions home page underneath the high school one. My admissions home was updated before my orientation session (as in it said UCLA had received both my cc and high school transcripts and my ap scores) but it‚Äôs different for each person. My DAR was not updated until my second day of orientation because my NSA had to input my cc class. Even for people who didn‚Äôt have dual enrollment classes they said their DAR wasn‚Äôt updated until the second day of orientation as well. You just gotta be patient and wait until your orientation because that‚Äôs when a lot of this stuff is taken care of. I know it‚Äôs frustrating and it makes you unsure but that‚Äôs basically the experience of every single person I‚Äôve talked to about orientation, including myself.","Yes, CC transcripts will show under your HS transcript. They updated for me, but that was because I sent my transcripts in a while ago for classes I took years ago lol.","The discussion for two of my classes have a time conflict, is there any way I can enroll in a different discussion time if other people drop it during second pass? If no one drops a different discussion time, do I have to pick a different class altogether?   also, this time conflict is a Math discussion and a com lit discussion. I read somewhere that math discussions aren't mandatory, is this ok?","If it's your only option, enroll with the conflict. Once you're in the class, you can either email the TA and ask to attend another section or post in the class website looking for someone to exchange sections with. Odds are pretty good that you're not the only one with a conflict.   There's a bit of risk associated with this, of course, but you'll probably be fine.","for humanities classes, discussion is usually mandatory. for math classes, discussion is sometimes mandatory. you won't find out until classes begin, so you should definitely monitor the discussion sections and try to switch discussion sections as soon as you can!   please note that during the first 2-3 weeks of the quarter, people will drop classes and add new ones, so all hope is not lost if people don't drop! just be patient :)  that being said i would still hunt for a different class during week 1 juuuuuust in case.","thank you for the advice! :) if I were to wait it out during the first 2-3 weeks of the quarter, should I ask to attend the classes? I know normally you'd attend the lectures but because it's online would I just try to obtain a zoom link?","Yes, and I think that is called ""auditing a class."" You should ask the prof if you can audit their class.","alright! If I had to pick one to audit and one to keep/enroll in, should I pick math 31a or com lit 2cw, which is an impacted class? I guess what I‚Äôm asking is which one do you think would someone more likely drop","The Math 30 series is infamous for people dropping, so I say that.","I know that regardless of orientation session you‚Äôre supposed to have an equal opportunity to get the courses you want, but I‚Äôm checking the course search and for example LS30A for Keranen is currently full (spots may open up though which will disregard my entire question). Are we supposed to have an equal chance at the class or the professor? Because I would find it unfair if those in earlier sessions can get the professors that are drastically easier than those in later sessions  Also, people advertise that orientation session doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúmatter.‚Äù Clearly, if specific (better) professors run out earlier, then the session DOES matter","All the LS30A professors are pretty good, I wouldn't worry about it.","Ya like the previous user said, please don‚Äôt worry about it too much. I just had orientation last week and I wanted to enroll in chem 20ah but it was closed all the way up until the day before enrollment. The class availability will update and you will have the same chance as everyone else to enroll in any lecture/discussion you want to for any class.",ucla reserves spots in classes like LS30A for freshmen for each orientation session -- they just show it's closed so no one else can enroll until the specified time at orientation sessions.,"Does anyone know where you see the TA for a course? Does it show when you press ‚Äúfind and enroll in a class‚Äù on MyUCLA where it would typically show the days, hours, course title, and prof?","If the TA's name is not listed, even UCLA doesn't know who your TA will be. I think most TAs will be updated by a week or 2 before classes start? Idk","Is anyone in the Mathematics/Applied Science Major? (Specifically the Medical & Lifesci plan) If so, what is it like?","if you want, i can tell you what math/applied math is like, since many of those classes are required for math/applied science!",Yeah sure! I'd appreciate that.,"okay, do you have any specific questions? there's a lot of classes you need to take and i don't know anything about your background/interests, so any specific questions would help me give you more targeted/useful advice, or just make it easier to figure out what to tell you beyond ""math at ucla is hard but your classmates and faculty are usually really friendly and helpful""","Math31A discussion section conflicts with Econ1 lecture dates/times. Does this mean I won't be able to take both? I was hoping that because the lectures were on different dates that I would be fine, but I think the discussion section is also important? Thanks!",I'd try emailing your Econ professor to ask if they plan on recording lectures. I had classes Spring Quarter that listed a specific time but I had to attend nothing live.,"It looks as if the econ lectures are not recorded. This unfortunately means that in order to take both at the same time, you will have to sacrifice your discussion time for Math. Math discussions are usually not mandatory, however.","I‚Äôm an incoming freshman.

Do I need to do this early on or should I do it in later years?

Is ls30a easier to enroll into than chem 14ae? I'm trying to plan out the order I'll enroll in","I‚Äôm also an incoming freshman without having ever enrolled in a class so take my advice lightly, but I do recall reading a post from an earlier session that said LS7A and LS30A‚Äôs enrollment wasn‚Äôt as difficult as other courses (as in spots were still open even after the enrollment window closed)","I‚Äôm a pre-health/pre-med/LS-undecided major who has a 5 on AP Psych and thus scored out of Psych 10. However, I do know that some graduate schools beyond UCLA don‚Äôt accept AP Credit. I found a link (located below) that shows that Psych 10 seems to be a common course for some of these schools. Should I just go ahead and skip out on it since I‚Äôve passed it with AP Psych credit?  The reason I‚Äôm asking is because although I have a 5 on AP Calc BC, I‚Äôm still planning on taking the LS30 series as of now (setting the precedent of taking the same-level courses despite AP test scores).   https://www.aap.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pre-Health-Requirements-092017.pdf","Unless you are a psych major or psychobio then you don't need to worry about taking Psych 10. Psych 10 is not a med school requirement, it is just that premed students take it to prepare for the MCAT.  Yes, you need to take the LS30 series because most med schools don't accept AP credit. The LS30 series is an easy A for both classes, AP Calc BC is an overkill for the course so you will be fine.","Makes sense. Had another quick question. From the link I sent, it shows that PIC10A seems to be an alternate for a math course for med school. Could I do the LS30 series and PIC10A and complete the ‚Äúmath‚Äù portion of these requirements?",I believe so but I don‚Äôt see why. Pic 10 doesn‚Äôt really have to do anything with life sciences and it‚Äôs geared more to CS majors. You also learn programming in the LS30 series.,"Am I allowed to take physics 5A since I got a 5 on Calc BC, without having the LS 30A/B or MATH 3A/B/C credit?","Yes, BC takes care of Math 31A and B credit and 3A and B. https://www.math.ucla.edu/ugrad/ap-credit",Are you premed?,"no, but i‚Äôm an environmental science major and i have to take either physics 5A/C or 1A/B.","You get credit for 31A/B, so you'd be done with math (but if you plan to minor in env. engineering you would have to take 32A) and be able to enroll in physics. I'd recommend the 5 series over the 1 series.","Mmm, okay. I would talk to your NSA about it because I know that AP Calc BC does waive Math 31A and B,  but the equivalent to that I would not know.","I'm an incoming MIMG major, and was wondering if I should take LS 7A or CHEM 14A first? Is one harder than the other? I'm trying to take it with LS 30A.","I would start the chem series since it consists of more classes. I would say 7A is harder since the tests are bs at its finest. Chem 14A is similar to high school chem, not too hard. 7A is mostly difficult because the tests are confusing and they don't actually reflect your understanding of the topic but of the questions. 14A you can succeed by looking at the professor's past exams and really understanding all the math involved. For this class, I would recommend Scerri since the exams are relatively easy, but Lavelle is not bad either.",Thanks! I'm gonna try to get 14A.,"Would it be too much to take math 31B (integration and infinite series) and 32A(calc with several variables) at the same time?

I think I heard that it is now ""free-for-all"" in some previous posts, but I am not sure. Something that I would do is place my top priorities first (on class planner) and then everything else after that. Make sure you have reliable internet and that you refresh class planner whenever the time begins. You should be fine, most premed classes have a lot of spots because they are so popular, so I would not worry too much about those, perhaps GE's because those can have limited spots (ex.

"Hey Bruins! A large portion of posts on our reddit are from clubs and organizations that advertise a product, service, or event. With the recent growth of the subreddit these posts are more common than ever. The moderators have recently run into a few issues moderating these posts since the wording of rule 3 is a bit vague. Since this became a recurrent issue lately, we decided that it should largely be up to the community to decide.  Should we allow advertisements from startups made by Bruins? What about a website or app made by a UCLA club?  What if its an organization advertising a potentially interesting product to multiple colleges, one of them being UCLA? What if an official UCLA association makes multiple posts that all could benefit the student body? What if its a paid program made by a Bruin?  Ultimately the moderators want to ensure that the reddit serves and benefits the student body which is why we're care so much about ad posts. So please, **help us decide the future of the subreddit by providing your thoughts on advertisements and their role in** r/ucla . **What type should be allowed? Which shouldn't? And why?**  We will appreciate all input so please share yours, whether its a few paragraphs or a few sentences.  I think /u/confirmedpenguin described the situation best:  >This sub has been growing really fast as of late and it seems a lot of orgs have discovered it's a good place to advertise themselves. This isn't a bad thing, it's actually a plus if we can give students a taste of UCLA online, but it can lead to some weirdness.","Maybe limit the number of posts a club can make in a certain amount of time? I think the free events and products are helpful for students, but we definitely want to avoid spam","A limited number of post is a method that we were considering, thanks for the input",How about a Reddit equivalent of the club fair at the start of the quarter? A few days for every club to post whatever kind of advertisement it wants.,This was also an idea brought up by u/123456789098765420 in the mod chat yesterday. A virtual enormous activities fair would be great.,"good idea, or one subreddit, Also if they post from one accout is ok. i.e. EngineeringClubUCLA, UCLATutoring.. because they are very useful services that help us.","Maybe have advertisements permitted one day a week? Otherwise clubs will just take over the subreddit. And also ban repeated advertisements with a bot or something if you can do so.  Also, (though this is likely your intention) advertisements should be beneficial to the users of the subreddit and highly relevant to UCLA students.",I like the idea of isolating a majority of promotions to a certain day. It would be like the Saturday classifieds or something. Having it all in a weekly megathread would probably be good for engagement as well.,Mega threads drown out a lot of responses. I'd say let them post but only on one day and each org/club/etc only gets to post every so often. Maybe oncd every quarter?,Noted about megathreads. The frequency still needs to be worked out a bit,"I like the idea of a ""happening this week"" thread, maybe with some ground rules to keep the noise down. One promo per org, no top-level comments that aren't promoting something, keep replies to a minimum?  Should advertising be limited to ""official"" UCLA-affiliated orgs? As opposed to the ""Check out this totally-not-for-profit app I, UCLA student, created for other UCLA students"" type of thing that can get spammy.",I think they should be limited to certain days and easily identified with a flair. Maybe we could have specific requirements for how they should be named?  &#x200B;  As long as it's pertinent to UCLA students I think it should be ok. We can always evaluate it again later if it gets out of control.,A flair isn't something we thought about it seems like it could help out. Right now the sub has lack of flairs for posts so it would be a good way to start using them,I think they‚Äôre fine. They actually help new students like me,"With everything online now, I welcome more clubs reaching out here to recruit. But IMO, there's a fine line between saying ""hey this is a fun club that exists, think about joining!"" and using this platform as Bruinwalk 2.0 (I'm talking about the actual walkway, not the website).  Nobody wants this sub to become like bruinwalk.  Maybe we can have something like we did with USAC during the election, where an org registers with a flair and can post information however frequently the mods decide? I think the answer here is to regulate who can post these types of things.  As for products, honestly they're way more annoying. I think all advertisers should also have to get a flair and should only be allowed to advertise if their product fits Rule 2, not just if they are a bruin.",Definitely should include a new flair if we are allowing Ads.   I think we should mandate flairs for advertisement so the users can understand that they are looking at an ad. Something along the lines of :   *[Ad] Come check out the UCLA Fantasy Football Club*  <insert description>,"while it is the online equivalent of being handed flyers on bruinwalk, I do think that isolating to a megathread/specific day would work best in order to keep the club advertising traffic down","Like someone mentioned, keep the ads limited to twice a month at least.

"Just got this email a couple minutes ago and wanted to share. He seems pretty sincere to me.  >Dear CS students,   >   >Recently, I learned about a petition concerning my role as chair of the computer science department at UCLA Samueli School of Engineering. The petition refers to some statements I made in March that were perceived as offensive and hence a reflection of my judgment. I sincerely apologize to those who felt offended. It is absolutely not my intention to make students feel discriminated against by my remarks. I wish to provide some context to these mistakes, and in doing so, I hope to reassure the students that I have always been deeply committed to the school‚Äôs vision for an equitable, inclusive and diverse culture.   >   >In mid-March, a retired CS professor, in an email thread discussing the science of virus spread, referred to the coronavirus as the ‚ÄúWuhan virus.‚Äù The essence of the thread was scientific and centered on figuring out the rate of branching during virus spread. A person who was on the email thread responded ‚Äì politely and gently ‚Äì that we should refrain from calling it the Wuhan virus. I must admit that in those early days of the pandemic, the term did not raise a red flag in my mind or sounded out of place. I interpreted the objection ‚Äì wrongly ‚Äì as an attempt to inject politics into a scientific discussion, and to muzzle my colleague. I proceeded, rather harshly, to try to contain the discussion before it got out of hand. By doing so, and then entering in a discussion about it, I unfortunately inserted and amplified politics in the exchange. I now wish that I had stayed quiet on the topic.   >   >I also did not realize that the person objecting was a graduate student, and that the email thread was not for CS faculty alone. We CS professors tend to have very frank discussions among ourselves ‚Äî it is a part of the culture of open discussion in our department. But this is of course not a suitable way to correspond with a student ‚Äî the power differential between students and faculty is simply too big to engage in this kind of frank discussion.   >   >Shortly afterwards, a colleague in CS made me aware that the political disputes between China and the U.S. had caused many in our Chinese/Asian communities to be blamed for the spread of the coronavirus, and that there had been incidents of physical assault. I also learned that the person who raised the concern in the original email was not a faculty member but a graduate student. Upon learning this, I immediately sent an email of apology to this student, and asked him to share it with others, which he graciously did. I subsequently learned that the exchange was shared on social media, and by then I was also starting to receive hate mail. I should have explained more completely what had transpired and apologized profusely for the anger and distress I had caused, but with social media involved, I decided to stay quiet and wanted to wait for an opportunity to continue the conversation more privately.   >   >The petition also suggests that I did not care about our undergraduate students due to my lack of active participation in an undergraduate open house held in February. At the time, I was a newly appointed chair of the department, and still learning about the various departmental functions. I felt it would be best to limit my contribution to giving a welcome to our students, and to leave the more substantive discussion on courses, prerequisites and other important issues to our undergraduate vice chair and other departmental leadership. I apologize to the students who perceived my early departure from the meeting as an expression of disinterest or lack of care. I was not aware at the time that this could be interpreted as such and, in hindsight, I should have stayed throughout the program.   >   >I really do care for my students and my door is always open to them, but I failed to convey this to the student community. The fact that none of the students representing these organizations who signed the petition approached me prior to taking action attests to my failure. This failure also explains the shock and surprise with which the petition was received by my colleagues, as they know that my intentions have always been good.   >   >It has brought me great sadness to learn that my unintentional actions and poor communication have caused many to feel hurt and angry. I have spent nearly 40 years of my life in this department, and care deeply about our faculty and students. I am sorry for the distress I have caused, and I will work with you to repair the resulting damage. I hope, going forward, we can build a relationship of trust which will allow you to reach out to me to discuss difficult issues such as these. Please know that your safety, comfort and success are deeply important to me.   >   >Sincerely,   >   >Eli Gafni  &#x200B;","And of course he didn't mention his other creepy comments in that thread, including ""Both Dick and I have Chinese wifes so I assure you we love Chinese people"", ""calling Eli Jaffe brave means my department is China"", and calling Eli, a graduate student standing up to him, ""a brave Israeli like me , just without the tenure""","Yea dude that Chinese wives comment was the nastiest one of them all, disappointed that he didn‚Äôt address that","> We CS professors tend to have very frank discussions among ourselves ‚Äî it is a part of the culture of open discussion in our department.  You occasionally hear people make offhanded remarks like what you mentioned in informal settings, but he must realize he can't do this any more given his role as an official voice of UCLA CS. Although he may have failed to address certain concerns in the email, at least he expressed good intentions, which is a great first step and much better than nothing.","hmmm...there is still some problematic phrasing in this letter: ""I sincerely apologize to those who felt offended"" and ""I apologize to the students who perceived my early departure from the meeting as an expression of disinterest or lack of care"" are more non-apologies than anything else. Like, saying it this way indicates that it's those who he offended who need to do a better job figuring out what he's really trying to say, instead of it being his job to just not offend people.  ""But this is of course not a suitable way to correspond with a student ‚Äî the power differential between students and faculty is simply too big to engage in this kind of frank discussion."" I feel like this misses the point -- what he said would still be rude or at least tone deaf even if he was talking to other faculty members exclusively in that email chain, especially because he didn't even realize until later he was talking to a grad student. It's still not obvious to me that he's realized what he's actually done wrong.   I do like the last 2 paragraphs -- it does seem like there he's figured out that simply having good intentions is not enough. I hope he's able to turn that into an opportunity to really learn from his mistakes and do better by the CS department and all those who take CS classes.","I also feel like he believed his poor conduct towards a graduate student was what's wrong rather than what he said. I don't think there's anything wrong with talking to faculty and students differently, but the more personal and disgusting statements he made obviously are not proper in any professional setting.

Otherwise he‚Äôs just being disingenuous,"Actually, I'd say they don't even know what is going on and just wanted to comment their ""correct"" opinion.","I think he‚Äôs finally been found accountable. The reason the students are angry is not because he used the term ‚ÄúWuhan Virus‚Äù, it‚Äôs because his inability to rectify his stance after a graduate student politely asked him to refrain from using the term. Professor Gafni doubled down and refused to apologize (until he realized that no one is on his side). His initial apology was sent out only to faculty and now after this petition had he sent this out to the entire CS department. If you refer back to the previous thread of this, you can see that his unprofessional rhetoric and speech has been documented many times . I cannot deny his contributions as a distinguished researcher, but his disregard of students opinion in my opinion does not warrant the position ‚ÄúDepartment Chair‚Äù. This petition was not to remove him as a professor, but to elect someone else as department chair who fosters undergraduate/graduate growth and better embodies UCLA ideals."

"Hi, I recently completed 2 years at a community college and will be transferring to UCLA in the fall. My mom and dad retired in 2018 and 2019 respectively, and withdrew from their 401k to pay off debts and my dad's medical bills after a cancer diagnosis. Due to this, our yearly income from the past 2 years shows up as much higher than it is.  As a result, I am receiving 0 financial aid from UCLA. The financial aid office says I cannot appeal this because my parents voluntarily took out their 401k, despite the circumstances. I've attempted to appeal Cal Grant, but haven't heard back from them yet. I've also been applying to scholarships, and because they are generally income-based, I haven't been able to receive any.  I've received 2 options for loans: an unsubsidized loan and parent plus loan. My parents are worried as unsubsidized loans collect interest once I accept it, and on top of that, their income from pension is going towards paying off our house mortgage.  I'm not sure how to go about this and would really appreciate advice. Thank you in advance.  **TL;DR: Parents withdrew from 401k to pay medical bills, yearly income shows up as massive, so FAFSA and UCLA are giving me 0 grant money.**",You might also want to post this in r/financialaid

"Edit: about 4.5K students on the hill. Weren‚Äôt Georgia and Notre dame holding in person classes?   By narrowing housing offers to those with such as foster kids, dealing with homelessness, what about those in adverse situations that do not have an official label? If they chose to live on campus because their home life is toxic, or if the environment isn‚Äôt suitable for taking college classes. Hard to wrap my head around. It‚Äôs even more upsetting that students at colleges with those growing outbreaks were attending parties and meeting together without masks. So fucking selfish  Edit: I understand that UCLA‚Äôs decision to cut housing contracts will be based on LA protocol, but more than anything, young adults organizing mass gatherings without any adherence to social distancing is the issue at hand.","i believe 5k students accepted housing on the hill and 1.5k ‚Äî in the apartments.  and i totally agree. i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that the new rules only allow students with ‚Äúno feasible residential option‚Äù to live on campus bc, as you said, there are a lot of other circumstances that would make it extremely difficult for people to focus and take classes, such as toxic household and the effect it may have on the student‚Äôs mental health, lack of good (or any) internet connection.   i‚Äôm also confused as to how it‚Äôs going to work since a lot of people have already accepted their efan and such.","Oh you‚Äôre right on the numbers. Sorry about that. Anyway, all of this s u c k s right now","I understand how frustrated you are cause I‚Äôm in the same situation as you, but like you mentioned, the LA county department of public health published new guidelines last Thursday that severely restrict the number of students that UCLA can house on campus. I think their hands are essentially tied. CalTech was forced to cancel their housing, USC had to shift to practically entirely online classes, and Harvey Mudd had to completely undo their reopening plan all within the last few days all because of the new guidelines. I think the decision is larger than just basing it off what happened in other schools around the nation. Also, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I‚Äôm pretty sure the 1.5k students who accepted housing was just in university-owned apartments and not the hill. All the information I‚Äôve seen about the number of students on the hill says that around 5k students were going to be living there in the fall quarter.",Anyone know when they plan to make an announcement for what will happen with housing?,"i contacted the housing earlier today and that‚Äôs what they said: ‚ÄúUCLA is working with senior leadership and the Future Planning Task Force to evaluate what has been advised and how we‚Äôll implement the guidelines. We hope to have an update soon and will keep students and families informed as soon as we have confirmed information. As of right now, no date has been set as to when more information will be released.‚Äù so, as of right now, no.","i read somewhere that at one of the colleges that had an outbreak (i‚Äôve been reading so many things, i forgot which school it was), the outbreak was traced back to a bunch of seniors throwing a party at an off campus apartment. unfortunately cancelling in person classes and limiting campus housing isn‚Äôt going to have any effect on what people do in their non university owned apartments",I believe it was Notre Dame,Was there some announcement made I‚Äôm not aware of? I thought ucla decided on all-single housing. Has that changed/been reduced further?,"LA county updated their protocol, allowing only students with no ‚Äúfeasible alternative‚Äù to live in campus housing. Not sure how they‚Äôre going to draft that. Other schools in the county have dropped the number of students living on campus to below 1k. Who knows how that applies to uni apartments",I hope that UCLA will interpret that statement as no feasible alternative near UCLA or the greater LA area. Perhaps that‚Äôs wishful thinking. There‚Äôs also a slim possibility that because of UCLA‚Äôs delayed start things could be starting to improve by the time classes begin. I hope one of these thing will be the case but realistically I expect not,"Housing isn't as good as you think it may be. Fields, libraries, food courts (literally everything) is closed. You are stuck in your room alone, and you gotta live like a prisoner. Outbreaks are impossible to control with COVID  because it has an airborne aspect to it as well so no matter how careful they are, there will be hundreds of students who get it and spread it around.   So I do support their decision to only offer housing to those with no other feasible option because it keeps us all safer and gives us hope for a winter or spring reopening :)","There‚Äôs campus, the beach, and nearby areas that you can enjoy socially distanced and safely. This might be a better alternative than being a ‚Äúprisoner‚Äù at home","Campus will be a ghost town, most of Westwood would be shut down, and last I checked people were still packing the beaches without concern for social distancing. If your home life isn't dogshit and you have somewhere safe to be, I really believe staying home is the move, or apartments if you really want.",I live south of Wilshire and the apartment manager across the street told me again last week she has a ton of vacant units. You might be able to get a deal on an off-campus apartment.,"It sucks that people won‚Äôt get housing. However, the quicker we get covid under control the quicker we can go back to normal. The worst thing that could happen is a failed restart in the fall. That would create more tensions for the winter and spring. Hopefully with the extremely reduced capacity in the fall things will be fine. Then UCLA can slowly start bringing back the rest of us in 2021."
"If so, what are you planning to do during this time? ü§ó",Poop and pee,Save dat money
Should I cancel my housing offer right now or wait till I get a message saying they rescinded my offer?,A parent from the parent Facebook page emailed UCLA and was told an announcement would be out by the end of the week so I‚Äôd at least wait until then.,Just wait,I am confused did they announce they are cancelling offers now to reduce capcity?,No it‚Äôs all speculative. Hoping they dont,Also wonder if anyone in admin reads this sub. Maybe this will persuade them to reconsider leaving as is since we don‚Äôt start for another month,"Ahh I see. That‚Äôs definitely good to know. Yeah, I am hoping also they don‚Äôt.","If you do end up cancelling your housing or the offer doesn't go through anymore (God forbid that happens), our group of 4 guys is looking for a subletter for the academic year if you are interested! Good luck with everything!"
"I'm a club leader, and just got an email to sign up for Instagram EAF lol.

"Is there any single greater abuse of supply and demand occurring in the COVID economy than online college classes??? I am an incoming freshman and every single one of my classes are going to be pre-recorded, meaning I am spending tens of thousands of dollars for what are essentially YouTube videos. And what other choice do I have? I sent in a request to defer, which was denied because UCLA needs my money, and if I choose to not enroll I basically have no chance of being accepted again at UCLA or any of the other schools I applied to. This doesn't even touch on the missing social aspects that usually come with freshman year of college, obviously out of UCLA's control but still depressing.   And despite all of this I am one of the lucky ones at UCLA!! As of now, I am going to be living in the dorms and I don't come from an abusive household or anything like that.   I understand that there are simply no good solutions in a global pandemic. Just thought I would vent a little because **this shit fucking sucks**.","Always remember, you're not paying for the classes, you're paying for the degree.","absolutely agree. it‚Äôs so great to hear someone be brutally honest about what‚Äôs going on, so many people in this sub (and everywhere I guess) have leaned so far into optimism it‚Äôs become delusion.","It‚Äôs not greed. Imagine if everybody deferred until Covid was over. The school would have a freshman class 2-3 times as large. It sucks that you‚Äôre having to start during a pandemic and you‚Äôre very unlucky but everybody seems to blame UCLA and I would be much more mad if as a freshman I couldn‚Äôt get into a single class because my freshman school size was massive.   Everybody at some point in history has gotten screwed, seniors entering the workforce right now are getting screwed, people who can‚Äôt afford to go to college anymore are getting screwed, you‚Äôre getting to go to a top university still and if you don‚Äôt want to do online classes then don‚Äôt go and do community college and apply later.","It‚Äôs not greed, but it is definitely for financial reasons. 1/5 of Harvard‚Äôs incoming class deferred to next fall. My friend requested a gap year at Northwestern and was approved in 20 minutes. So while I recognize the shittiness of the situation for everyone I do put some blame on UCLA.",those be privatesss hahah ucla doesnt get to decide everything on their own,I understand it‚Äôs a different situation. Just voicing my frustration,Yeah it‚Äôs fucking Harvard whose boosters shit millions of dollars into the school hourly.   None of this is UCLA. The school is at capacity already. If you defer kids it will just be making issues further down the line that will forever be compounded and be much harder to fix.,I understand it‚Äôs a different situation but UCLA still has a multi billion dollar endowment. Allowing kids to defer would make it slightly harder to get in next year? Is that really the worst thing ever in these circumstances.,Yes it is. Now because you don‚Äôt want to take online classes some kid who has been working their entire life towards UCLA might miss out on the shot at it. Quit being a selfish person and do one of the following:  1. Continue your education  2. Do everybody a favor and drop out to let somebody with a moral compass attend.,Jesus dude I put rant in the title. Complaining about the situation and not wanting to pay thousands for online classes makes me not have a moral compass?,Yes as you‚Äôre completely fine with screwing other people out of their education to have a social life at college. You really don‚Äôt have one no matter how far down this path of self-reassurance you go.,I know you can take a quarter or two off. so maybe give the fall a shot and then take a break,I highly encourage people to not upvote this post. OP has already mentioned they are fine with people not getting in next year so they can have a social year as a freshmen.,"Here‚Äôs what I would do: if they declined your request to defer, take super easy GEs or something for a quarter and then take winter and spring off. You can take one quarter off no questions asked and if you take two off you have to apply for readmission. Applying for readmission is essentially filling out a petition and if you did well in you fall classes it‚Äôs essentially guaranteed.",This is pretty much my plan after seeing how the fall goes. Do you think there‚Äôs any chance readmission does become competitive with so many people taking time off?,No I seriously doubt it. Make sure you get straight As your first quarter so they have no reason to deny you.,"Yes, it sucks.  But it's not UCLA's fault.  Professors still need to be paid, and online teaching is much harder for them than in-person teaching, at least at first.","This ""pandemic"" has exposed the dangerous capabilities of the government and the university system and how we don't actually have any control over any of it. Even five years ago this whole online-learning-for-more-than-a-year-but-still-pay-full-tuition thing would not have been approved at all. But people think that accepting this valueless product is helping out the gReAtEr GoOd. Universities have succeeded in making themselves a necessity in our society, and because of that can devalue their product with no repercussions.",lol
"hii, everyone! since LA county recently released new guidelines for on-campus housing that stated that only students with ‚Äúno feasible residential option‚Äù will be allowed to live on-campus, which is probably going to result in most students‚Äô housing contracts (including mine) being cancelled.  i was wondering how do you think the process will look like, especially if i already accepted my efan for on-campus housing? like do you think they would have to re-assess efans for those whose contracts would be cancelled and we‚Äôd accept it the new one?   also, if you have efc 0 and don‚Äôt mind sharing (in the comments or pms), how much in aid (and how much in grants?) did you get if you‚Äôre a commuter? if you‚Äôre going to live off-campus. (i‚Äôm an incoming freshman and also have blue & gold)   for commuters, did you lose your uc ship grant? if you did, did you still get enough aid in grants to pay for it? (again, asking if you have efc 0)  i‚Äôm kind of worried as it is getting closer to the deadline to accept the aid and pay for tuition and other costs. i am going to call financial aid bc i know they‚Äôre the only ones who would be able to give me a more specific answer but i‚Äôm not sure if i should wait till ucla makes an official announcement or just call and ask now..","Hi! I have a 0 EFC and will be living as a ‚Äúcommuter‚Äù at home. I was offered Pell grant and Cal grant in the usual amount I would receive if I lived on-campus, so that didn‚Äôt change.

Currently a second year undergrad. I‚Äôm having a dilemma on how much to charge per hour as a private tutor. I was offered about $23 per hour for two kids and I was wondering if that was reasonable and wanted to find out what the typical rates are. Thanks!,"I charge $25/hour for 1 person, but I also tutor other UCLA students (I don't know how old the kids you're tutoring are). I also charged $30/hour for an incoming grad student who wanted to brush up on math.  For groups I would definitely charge more overall, but less per person -- like if I was going to tutor 2 at the same time, I would charge $40 overall.","It depends on the topic and your expertise. Tutoring algebra will not result in as high pay as tutoring advanced level math courses, as there are not as many people that can do that. Additionally someone with a PhD will likely be better at teaching than an undergrad simply due to experience.  23$ is likely fine given your experience and that they are kids",I charge 25/hr for one on one sessions (usually high school or college tho)
"hey so i‚Äôm an incoming first year and i apologize if this question is dumb or has been answered before.  i was offered a housing contract for the fall and accepted it so my financial aid award reflects that. with everything going on, i‚Äôve pretty much accepted that on-campus housing won‚Äôt happen and even if it did, i‚Äôm not sure i would want to live there. i‚Äôm weighing my options right now between remote and off campus apartments. it‚Äôs kind of hard to that without knowing how exactly my financial aid will change however. i have an efc of 0 and have the blue&gold promise. i know a couple of people have said if we switch to remote, we‚Äôll lose everything except for cal/pell. i want to know what my aid will look like if i switch to off campus so that i can know my budget when looking for apartments etc.   if anyone has an efc 0 and is off campus, i would appreciate a comment or pm helping me gauge what my aid would look like. also, is there any way for me to get this tentative aid from housing w/o filing a readjustment form?","Hello, I recently canceled my housing and I have basically the same condition as you with blue and gold and and EFC of 0. The grants I have now are the Cal Grant A, the Fed supplemental grant of 800$, and the pell grant. The amount did not change, but I no longer have the University or SHIP grant. And my work study offer was originally $2500 but now is $2497, which is $3 less for some odd reason. And I‚Äôm not sure how to answer that last question but there might be a financial aid calculator ? but I hoped this helped",hey! are you set to off campus or remote?,Oh! sorry I forgot to mention that I changed to remote xD

,Oh my this is top tier,wait so did they say anything about adjusting financial aid or are we all just fucked,F,You forgot all the extra loans,Was the scholarship that disappeared a real scholarship (based on merit) or just called a scholarship (though actually a grant)?

Does anyone know if it's possible for a department to make an exception for a student that has violated the academic repeat policy?

For some reason I can‚Äôt figure this out anywhere. Does ucla discourage this. I‚Äôm a rising sophmore,"Took a gap year in my junior year.  First thing, if you're international, things get wildly more complex.  But assuming you're from US and that you're taking a gap year for reasons other than academic difficulty, you should first discuss it with a counselor. They'll help you plan out the rest of your degree and know nuances that might apply to your case specifically.  When you come back from the gap, you'll be applying as a readmission student (which is where things get highly complicated for internationals). Apart from readmission related paperwork, you'll also need a ECP exit plan and a degree contract signed by dept.   Counselors will neither encourage nor discourage, they're simply there to guide you in your journey. They will however let you know all the drawbacks, and ultimately the decision would be in your hands.","Is non-attendance for the gap year done quarter-by-quarter for the first two quarters? Since a single gap quarter is pretty straightforward, then OP could do fall quarter off as a start, then reassess too see if they want to continue?","UCLA doesn't allow it, officially, unless you have a military deployment or something equally serious.  I think the most you can take is a gap quarter, and even that has to be justified IIRC (family death, etc.).","No, a single gap quarter doesn't have to be justified. You can declare non-attendance for 1 quarter without having to go through the readmission process."

With guidelines (ie all but the absolute needed) is about 1k,"It amazes me that LA country cracks down on what would be socially distanced housing (UCLA  already cancelling most campus housing), yet does NOTHING about the insanely populated house parties being thrown every day in LA mansions.","I mean they're were trying to solve it by threating to shut of their utilities, which was probably the most harmless and effect method of a deterrence, but people were complaining about how thats not ethical/ in the power",Does UCLA have a choice or will all housing offers for students without an absolute necessity (‚Äúno feasible alternative‚Äù) be now rescinded?,Universities must adhere to public health policies unfortunately,"This isn't true, plenty of universities across the country are ignoring health department regulations/recommendations. UCLA could still easily cancel all housing but that hasn't happened yet.",Does this apply to university apartments too?,I‚Äôm gonna be salty if they pull my housing :/,"The new policy sucks.

You guys know any singles that are around $750? I'm asking for my friend who's a guy.,Not sure if you‚Äôll find something like that. Considering doubles start at around $850.   At that price you‚Äôd probably looking at a triple.,Unfortunately no. However me and my apartment mates are looking to find a subletter who can afford $875 rent. In addition there's utilities/internet/water and thus in total the monthly payments would equal $920.  I know that's a high price but it's cheaper than other places. We're a group of four looking for a fifth. If that's something your friend wants lmk.

Feels like they haven't handled this/communication well at all, might not be entirely their fault though.",A few days ago I asked housing and was told they would announce move in days and times and room assignments near the end of August.

"I'm an incoming AOS 2nd year and took Chem 17 last fall and had a pretty bad experience with the prof. I started off HBS and had no experience with chemistry, but the professor didn't explain topics well and I put off chem to do other prereqs. Should I take 20A with Felker who doesn't have the best ratings or 20AH which is more difficult? I took AP Physics A and B and am going to take 32A in the fall.  E: AP Physics 1 and 2, not A and B","I‚Äôm an incoming freshman but I decided to take 20ah instead of 20a for pretty much the same reason that you mentioned. I was talking with other freshman about this and many said that their friends who went to UCLA told them to try their best to avoid Felker because he really isn‚Äôt a good professor to have starting off at UCLA. At orientation, my NSA did tell me that since it‚Äôs an honors class, 20ah will have a pretty heavy workload but I mean it is only one quarter and you can choose to just take the normal 20b in winter quarter (depending on availability and who‚Äôs teaching it of course). Also, considering the big disparity between positive reviews for the two teachers, I think Gelbart for 20ah might be the move. Many people also pointed out that Gelbart is willing and ready to help students who are struggling and he will make sure you understand before a test whereas many said that Felker was condescending and not very helpful in his lectures or office hours. I know you can‚Äôt really judge a professor based off of the online opinions of anonymous students, but this is just the conclusion that I‚Äôve come to. Hope it helped!","I wouldn't recommend Chem 20AH if you don't have a pretty solid foundation in chemistry. If you are comfortable with the modern physics from AP Physics 2, some of the concepts might be familiar, but you'll be looking at them from a more mathematically intensive view."

Now I'm in grad school and working a steady job that I love. Fuck UCLA STEM's grading based on averages.","And when the median is a B-/C+ no matter what, the median GPA is a 2.5.  It's like UCLA is trying to set their students up for failure.  So many jobs and schools have a 3.0 requirement.","Forced me out of state for grad school.

I literally created my schedule around getting maloy (not maloy and braybook i think?) and avoiding pires at all costs,"These are your first few quarters at UCLA. It's completely normal to get below average score, with or without remote learning. There's really no shame to being below average - we've all been there at one point or another.  One thing that takes a really long time to unlearn is this mindset that you need to get an A (or get above average on an exam) or else you're a failure. You're not. Don't fall into this mindset. Like yeah, some of your peers will get better grades. Some will get worse. You will just have to adapt, either by changing your studying habits or being content with the grade that you get. You have a ton of time to make up for a low grade, both in the class and for the next four years.  Plus, STEM classes here are admittedly fucked up. For a lot of people, they find out that they need to step up their study habits after getting their first exam score back. It's easy to coast through high school, only to be hit with some of these weeder classes (I know from experience!). You also get this dilemma where you either get super hard exams and low means or easy exams coupled with extremely high averages, meaning that if you make a couple of mistakes here or there, you're already below the average.  There have been classes that I've been in or that I've heard of having 90s as the average. It's pretty uncommon (most STEM classes have means or medians in the low 80s or high 70s, with low 70s or high 60s being common among classes like organic chem), but it's not impossible, especially when the exam is easier than expected. There's one class where the median was 100, but that's definitely an unique circumstance.  I second that there's most likely some collaboration going on. It's also possible that the exam was really easy for a lot of people, with or without collaboration, but I didn't take the test so I don't know. There's always going to be *some* collaboration during remote learning, although the extent of it depends on the students.","Really calling me out with that second paragraph!

He is such an awesome professor and I love pretty much everything he does. But I feel like I studied really hard and the test felt easy so I‚Äôm kinda disappointed... happy to hear that this isn‚Äôt always the case  Since most people taking it are sophomores and juniors, maybe I‚Äôm just not quite adapted to how classes work yet.","You should be fine! Tung grades on a straight scale and according to my friend he gave them a ton of extra credit~15% . Got to OH , the most underused resource as well as TA OH if you have any doubts. All the best!!","Yes, going to office hours for both Tung and the TA is part of my master plan for this class! Wishing you the best too!!!","Keep ur chin up!! I was in 5B last spring and I got an 80 on the first midterm when the average was a 95 (or something higher I don't remember). I still left the class with an A and killed it on the rest of the tests. We might be below average in intellect but nothing beats hard work and practice, ESPECIALLY in an open-note situation :) Also keep in mind there's some major grade inflation going on, because the 5 series exams usually have averages from 60 to 75, and seeing that it's 100 atm, power to you guys.","With letters and science classes (physics 5 series included), it is usually a straight grading scheme. Don‚Äôt get caught up on the averages or what other people got- life science professors don‚Äôt usually curve down.   Focus on what you can do to improve your learning (which will ultimately be a lot more helpful).  For physics, know how to do everywhere physics question you are given and ask questions to your peers, TA‚Äôs, and professors. You got this! You are in a good range.","Thank you! Yeah, I‚Äôm trying to make a game plan for myself to try and understand concepts better! To say physics was my least favorite high school subject is an understatement.

Some other tips:  TIPS FOR STUDYING:  -know how to solve every example question in the lecture slides!! (If u have them)  -when practicing, do not consult an answer key until you box a final answer (it can be tempting to check while you are in the middle of solving)  -note and try diff methods a problem can be solved (multiple equations can work for a question in physics)   -look into even more practice for confusing concepts: there is a ton of material on mechanics and energy online (watch videos)   -OH! It‚Äôs great that you are going. For any question you are even a bit confused about, ask them. It‚Äôs helpful to hear their thought process and see them solve it out.   TIPS FOR OPEN NOTE TEST:  -have an equation sheet and write the UNITS needed for each variable   -KEEP track of your UNITS-easy way to lose points. Know how to convert between diff ones as well  -since it‚Äôs 24 hours, double check your answers with diff methods/ equations  Here are some general tips.

"The current state of UCLA was inevitable. As tuition continued to climb over the years, we reluctantly accepted it. We thought it was worth it to fork out a few more dollars because the social experience, the connections, the campus life, the shift to adulthood - none of it could be rivaled. And maybe that was worth the money.   But now? What are we left with? UCLA has power over us, and so they can devalue their product and there is not one thing we can do to stop it. Even if you stripped away all of the social benefits to attending a prestigious university, all the connections and the experiences - the classes might still be worth it, at least for most people.   But what we have now is not ""university classes"". Anyone who genuinely thinks that Zoom classes are a worthy substitute for in-person classes is lying to themselves. Even if everyone has their camera and microphone enabled, even if we're all looking at everyone's faces through the screen, even if we're having a legitimate conversation; it lacks the nuance of human interaction that makes being in-person valuable. You just cannot form connections virtually. You don't get to meet someone in a class and then decide to go out for lunch later with a few friends to get to know them better. You're in whatever ""class"" setting forged your interaction, and then when class is over, you may as well have never met that person to begin with.  I've seen people bring up the argument that ""people have been making friends online for a long time"" and trying to justify the existence of dating apps as proof that this can all work. But it can't. Social bonds form naturally over time. In those situations, people have the explicit goal of meeting someone and getting to know them. That isn't the case with online university.  And here's where it gets really shitty with UCLA - most universities have been very generous with allowing students to defer, or take a gap year so they can finish their degree with value. But UCLA has done no such thing. Do you have an attention disorder that prevents you from being able to focus in online classes? Sucks for you. Does your home situation make it impossible to concentrate? Sucks for you. Are you experiencing suicidal thoughts and depression because this was the only thing you had going for you? Sucks for you. UCLA isn't here to help their students; they're here to squeeze their students for every last penny, every last drop of optimism, of hope, of happiness.   Take orientation for example. I had an absolutely garbage experience with my online orientation. I had to shell out $135 just to get classes, and if I had a choice I wouldn't have paid as much as $5 for what I received. It's sloppy, it's worthless, it's evil.   I've seen countless petitions for things like changing the name of a staircase on campus, firing a department head for making off kilter comments, and much more petty, unimportant crap like that that makes me wonder where our priorities really are. We should be making petitions to make our education cheaper. To allow us to take the year off. To demand our education has some kind of value outside of the ""degree that opens up doors"" at the end of it.   Something has to change.","Yo dude. Sorry that your freshmen year has to be online but it‚Äôs inevitable. Every school is switching to online and you can take a gap year or quarter if you need to. The r√©admission process is usually just a procedure they go through and if you really need to take the time off I think it‚Äôs reasonable. I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôm a CS major in which online classes really don‚Äôt affect me much and actually makes it easier for me to go to office hours.   Obviously tuition didn‚Äôt get cut and it does suck that we have to be online but with a global pandemic, ucla loses probably 40-50 percent of revenue (hospital and sports). At the end of the day, schools are run like a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù.","I‚Äôm not in the CS department, so I can‚Äôt speak with firsthand knowledge. But it seems like having someone that has made hostile learning environments for students as department chair is not petty or unimportant. That is a decision that can impact many students for years to come. Just because it is unimportant to you does not make it unimportant.",I mean I think the reality is that you don‚Äôt believe the pandemic is real.,"This is depression,","Any institution that relies on the state to function is inevitably going to face these issues.  The UC administration and the CA state administration as a whole is able to get away with incompetence and a lack of accountability because they are not politically challenged nor financially threatened.    Unless we appeal to the private donors, who regularly dump millions into creating new buildings and other campus developments, nothing will change.  They are our best form of leverage against a cheapened education."
hi i‚Äôm an incoming freshman currently in pre psych.

Does the Spanish department accept people off the wait list from Spanish 1-3?,I remember for Spanish 3 people from the waitlist who showed up were almost all added.

"Im gonna be a freshman this fall and Im honestly kind of confused on the loan aspect. After the grants Im gonna need about 10k in order to cover the cost of attendance, and this was divided among 4 different loans and work study that UCLA offered, however Im really only interested in taking the subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Would it be possible for me to ask for more money from these loans since these are the only ones I want to accept, or is that only possible for the parent loan?","You don't have to take all the loans. And no you cannot ask for more. CoA is very exaggerated. You do not have to pay anywhere near that amount. The only things you have to pay for are Tuition, Housing (if you're living on campus), and UCSHIP if you didn't waive it."
"Hi,   I took a math course at a local CC and sent in the official transcript which UCLA received today. However, my degree audit report and transfer evaluations did not update yet, so I was wondering if I needed to contact the registrar office? My new student orientation is coming up so I'm worried that if I'm not assigned these credits I won't be able to bypass some pre-reqs. Thank you","It takes roughly a month for the courses to be evaluated and embedded into your UCLA DARS. Have an unofficial transcript of those courses ready for your orientation, and that should be sufficient.","I was in the same situation as you. My DARs wasn‚Äôt updated until my second day of orientation. From what my NSA told us, it seems like they have to update things manually so don‚Äôt freak out right now. Your NSA will make you submit an academic profile the day before your orientation starts and you will be able to list all your test scores as well as dual enrollment classes which will allow your NSA to update your DARs by the second day. Do have your transcript ready tho because they may ask to see it."

Hi! I‚Äôm (F17) a senior in high school and was wondering if UCLA has a good undergrad program for UI and/or UX. I‚Äôm a first-gen student and so I‚Äôm super lost on what to do. Please help! Thank you :),"I recently graduated as a Cognitive science major and my career path is UIUX.  Many of my fellow cog sci major friends are also doing UIUX, BUT  UCLA‚Äôs Cog Sci major teaches you basically nothing about UIUX. The major is mostly psychology classes with a requirement of 3 coding classes and sprinkle of other courses because the major is officially under the psych department.  You should check online for the courses required for this major for a better idea.  I mean, I did learn some cool psychology related stuff regarding memory, learning, visual illusions, but nothing applicable for actually designing.   Other than DESMA, this major is the closest thing to UIUX but still far from it.  95% of my design portfolio and knowledge comes from self learning.    Good luck with your journey through UIUX!  I would suggest looking into University of Washington‚Äôs Design major and working on your design portfolio if you want to major in something design related because some college apps require a design portfolio.",thank you so much! do you know how well desma flows into UIUX?,"I‚Äôm a desma major and its mainly very new media art and graphic design. There is DESMA 28 (Interactivity) and DESMA 161 (Network Media) that dive into interactive coding/web design/art stuff, not really exactly UIUX. Digital Humanities (a possible minor) has a UIUX class (DH 150) but overall the minor is not only UIUX, it‚Äôs a lot of data visualization/science.",ohhh wonderful. i had no idea UCLA even had that. do you know anyone at UCLA who is pursuing UIUX? maybe not necessarily a DESMA major (since a lot of these comments are saying a lot of cog sci majors are pursuing it too) that i could get advice from?,"I am actually pursuing UIUX myself and know tons of cogsci/desma majors who are, you can PM me. Personally though, I think UCSD is the best bet for UIUX within the UCs, they have the best cogsci department with a specialization in Design and Interaction (UCLA‚Äôs is not that great, it‚Äôs a part of the psychology department and as the commenter said, it‚Äôs psych and a sprinkle of other things). UCSD also has Don Norman as a professor in the department and the Director of UCSD‚Äôs Design Lab. He‚Äôs iconic in the user experience world and authored The Design of Everyday Things, I‚Äôm almost envious.",I‚Äôm not sure how helpful this is but a lottt of the cognitive science majors here are going into UI/UX design so maybe you can try looking into that program. In the fall they‚Äôre going to be offering a new class specifically on that for cog sci majors too,What‚Äôs the class called?,Psych 188B: Fundamentals of User Experience,okay thank you!,SMC has a bachelor's degree in Interaction Design which you can check out,oh thank you! i didn‚Äôt even know that existed,"Would look into the Design Media Arts major (not too sure about the ux emphasis, seems more design based) or cognitive science! Cog sci doesn‚Äôt have too many specific ui/ux classes, but I have friends who are on that career path in that major. They do a lot of extracurriculars to learn more","i‚Äôm looking to do more UI, but i realized that the job market wants someone who is proficient in both. i‚Äôll check them out, ty!"
I‚Äôm 3 classes into upper divs and am curious to know how difficult the classes to come will be. Edit: I‚Äôm in aerospace engineering,"I feel like the ""prereq"" upper divs are harder than most of the later classes, possibly just because they're trying to fit more material into a quarter.  For example, I've heard rumors that 107 is one of the toughest classes in the department, and it's certainly one of the few classes I got a B in.  But I know a lot of people struggle in dynamics, thermo, transport, and intro fluids.  I feel like the classes beyond 107 start to get more specialized and thus not only more ""interesting"" (in that they're more obviously part of the major) but also often smaller class sizes with more focus.  But bear in mind that the reason those early classes are required is that the material comes up again in later courses (161B, which I just took over the summer, revisits statics, dynamics, thermo, and transport, for example)."
"I was wondering for those who have gone through the CS major/classes at UCLA or are currently doing so, how would you rank the classes you have taken from hardest to easiest that are of the CS subject area?",General consensus is that CS 35L is hell on Earth.,"From the major requisites, should go something like. Also read this from top to bottom, I‚Äôm too lazy to reverse it.  CS 30 (that really basic intro class idk what they renamed it to.)  CS 31.  CS 180.  CS M152A.  CS M51A. (Diagrams are annoying.)

(Diagrams are annoying.)  CS 35L. (More tedious than hard.)  CS 131. (Universally considered difficult from my group of friends.

Hi! I'm an incoming freshman this year. I applied undecided but I'm pretty sure I'll major in poli sci on the pre law track. I don't really know much about picking classes and my orientation is in early september so I'm wondering what would be some good classes for me to try to get for my first quarter. Thanks for any advice!,"Any lower div (I recommend PS50 or PS20), and 2 GEs. I did a cluster which knocked out a bunch of science GEs.  My schedule freshman fall was PS20, History 9D, and Cluster M1. I‚Äôm a poli sci and IDS major and all of the classes wound up counting to one of the majors which was sick","\^I agree ps10, 20, and 50 are great intros to the major and you're gonna have to take them at some point. Science based clusters knock out a ton of GEs and they're really interesting. Just explore and don't stress too much especially for your first q. Good luck!","i had my orientation last week and got PS50 as one of my classes. i know absolutely 0 things about comp politics, do you have any advice for the class/what to expect?",Who‚Äôs the prof? I had Lofchie and he was super kind and understanding about COVID. No previous experience necessary. Lower divs are designed as intro classes,"Prioritize lower div PoliSci classes - doesn't matter which, whatever you can get into. While you can enroll in upper division courses before you declare the major, you can only do so during second pass - so it's in your interest to get those lower divs done ASAP.   I was PoliSci and prelaw. Feel free to shoot questions my way.","Did you take Poli Sci 30 with Chwe? If so, how was it? Any recommendations on professors or courses for the future? I‚Äôm taking poli30 and 149 this quarter (transfer)","I took 30 with Bawn. Definitely the toughest lowerdiv GE, and I understand that it's moreso with Chwe (the guy has a reputation as being one to avoid if you're interested in keeping your GPA up - take a look at grade distributions on Bruinwalk).   149 is the identifier used for variable topics courses in the American Politics subfield, so the actual class and instructor will change quarter-to-quarter (I.e., Bruinwalk is likely to be useless). In Fall it's being taught by a grad student I've never heard of, so I can't be much help there I'm afraid.   For the future: there are several great professors in the department.  Posner (CP), Larson (IR), and Zaller (AP) are my ""must-take"" recommendations.",Poli sci 20 is a rlly easy ge !

"Context:   I (M16) am currently a sophomore in high school and want to go UCLA. I came to the US in 8th grade with no English and worked my way up to honors English 2, honors chem and alg 2 trig but could not take any AP classes due to them being overfilled. I know that colleges like UCLA require 5 or more AP classes and to be honest I really am out of ideas. I have many questions but my academic advisor won‚Äôt return to me because she is busy so I figured that I would ask some questions here instead:  1-) Do AP and Honors classes differ in your college application? I know that APs give college credit but do honors classes still look as good as AP classes?  2-) Is taking at least 5 AP classes absolutely necessary to get in UCLA? Or is it a mix of AP and Honors classes?  (I live in Cali btw if that info is necessary)","UCs don‚Äôt require AP or honors classes but they do look good on applications and can help exempt you from classes. If you really can‚Äôt take AP or honors, you can focus on something else since applicants are weighed holistically. Like great test scores or leadership and extracurriculars. Having dual enrollment with a CC is a better substitute for AP/IB classes, but make sure the class transfers by checking transferology and I think there‚Äôs a limit to how many units you can take.  Also chill out a bit, you‚Äôre only a sophomore. You have time to take AP classes and enjoy high school","Hey! I came to the US when I was about 4 years old and I also didn‚Äôt have enough APs in highschool! But I got into UCLA, your story resignates with how I felt when I applied but today I am now an upcoming senior! Would love to chat with you about this and answer any questions you may have :)","There is no AP class requirement for admission to UCLA. However, not having taken AP classes that your school offered (even though they were overfilled) looks bad on your applications, unfortunately.  AP usually looks better than Honors if your school offers Honors and AP, since some schools' honors programs aren't really much harder than the standard high school level courses.  Try and get some A grades in APs in your Junior year, as it's more significant than your sophomore year in your application. Also, remember that your extracurriculars, volunteer hours, and personal statements affect your application as well.  All this depends on what major your going for, though. Some are extremely competitive, but getting into others might be feasible with an unimpressive GPA, assuming you have an otherwise strong application.","1) Not a whole lot honestly. I think APs look slightly better . I don‚Äôt think your whole application will be tossed because you took an honors course vs an AP.   2) I didn‚Äôt take the most intense course load and still got in. If you take 5 APs/ Honors then you should be fine. Its more important that you do well in those classes. Its not worthing doing a heavy schedule and getting a bad grade. That will hurt a lot more in the long-run. Do the maximum rigor you can without burning yourself out.   I have seen people from my school get in with your course rigor as a sophomore you are fine honestly. Just make sure you do well in your classes. Its good that you are making sure you are on the right track early.  Edit: I also want to add that I didn‚Äôt have a 4.0 gpa. My grades were alright but they definitely weren‚Äôt as good as most of the people that got in. I think everything else in my profile was solid. I had pretty good ECs and awesome Personal Insight Questions. So, there‚Äôs definitely more than just grades to it. Also, your only a sophomore so don‚Äôt worry too much and enjoy your high school experience!","I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any strict requirements for Honors/AP classes. As long as you‚Äôre taking on challenging coursework (for your school) and doing well in them, you should be okay. IMO the thing that is most important is finding what you‚Äôre passionate about and really honing into that on your app. Work hard at something you love and have something to show for it on your EC page and let your passion shine through your essays. You‚Äôre still a kid, grind hard but remember to enjoy those high school years! I stressed way too much about college in high school and it was not really necessary tbh. You‚Äôll end up right where you‚Äôre supposed to be as long as you try your best and focus on what you love. Good luck :)",hey good luck with high school!! I would recommend taking dual enrollment/college classes at a local community college if you can. they usually don‚Äôt cost anything unlike taking AP tests and they give you college credit as well!

,If we don‚Äôt start a WAP challenge at Ben Shapiros alma mater... idk what ima do with myself ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,I get surprised every time I remember that he went here.,be lucky you weren't around when he was writing in the Daily Bruin. His columns were so painful,His townhall ones were even worse. Saying that he'd rather have a thousand Palestinian people die than one Israeli.,"I don‚Äôt remember any monstrous ones like that, that‚Äôs true. Just a lot of victimization because he was a conservative at UCLA",Do you have any links or papers so I can avoid them?,You can search them on the DB site. The worst one that I remember was about an adult store that opened in Westwood.,why is it surprising?,There are not many conservatives of the Ben Shapiro variety in the student population. They don't exactly flock to a school known for being progressive. When I think of people who represent UCLA he's one of the last people I'd think of.,"Tbh I‚Äôve explored some of his views because time and time again I‚Äôve heard how racist he is, and a couple of my friends wanted to protest against him when he was speaking at USC not too long ago. I figured before I joined them I‚Äôd do some research into what he said that was so flagrant, because when I asked them they essentially just told me he‚Äôs ‚Äúin the alt-right or something.‚Äù After doing my research, I concluded that while I don‚Äôt agree with many of his views, I struggle to see how he is that different from a regular conservative or right-winger. His ideologies seem right in line with the average conservative, it‚Äôs just he tends to have an arrogant flair about him when he speaks or debates, which is why it may come off more radical than it really is. In that sense, I think it‚Äôs problematic that we consider the fact that a conservative would go to UCLA is ‚Äúsurprising.‚Äù You say it‚Äôs because UCLA is mainly progressive, which I can certainly attest to having just graduated from here. But so are most (if not all) elite universities in the US. As such, political climate is just something a number of students (particularly non-progressives) just bite the bullet on when deciding on attending an elite college. I get how most universities are progressive, but it‚Äôd be really nice if campuses could promote some level of political diversity. I can only speak for UCLA as it‚Äôs the only university I‚Äôve attended, but at this school I always felt like there could‚Äôve been a more open climate to share differing political ideas. The amount of times I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúanyone who supports trump is a white supremacist‚Äù by fellow students honestly hurts my head. And I‚Äôm not even a trump supporter, i just think it‚Äôs silly to label anyone having conservative values as a racist/bigot without more context","It has more to do with UCLA being a large state school, than it being unwelcoming to conservatives. There are less conservatively angled good universities out there. Princeton, Duke, UVA, Notre Dame, BC etc  Fundamentally Shapiro‚Äôs message is one of selfishness and a lack of compassion. He‚Äôs not a bogeyman like woke twitter thinks nor is he significantly more racist than the average person. There‚Äôs just not much to talk about when one side believes you help people by giving them aid and the other side believes that giving aid to people makes them soft and lazy.  In any case, Trump hardly embodies conservative ideas. So yes, anyone who supports him is at the very least willing to tolerate an undeniable racist who loves to dog whistle white nationalists. Why do you think many conservatives have made it clear they don‚Äôt endorse him?",Get that wet ass p-word all over campus  Edit: a ben shapiro listener has downvoted me oh god,I did the #WAPChallenge in front of the UCLA Anderson School of Management building and these two icons responded üôàüíôüíõ#BruWins,We love to see it,Ahaha that‚Äôs great i just followed ur ig cuz I got accepted to ucla but know noone. you killed it,What a legend!,thank you so much!,"No problem!!

The last point in the email was that things could change though, so it‚Äôs just a waiting game to see if housing will be further affected or not.","Might want to keep on eye on some of the County Health guidances: http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/guidances.htm#education  [The current draft proposal](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_HigherEducation.pdf) still allows housing with many restrictions, but only for students without feasible alternatives.","By ‚Äòstudents without feasible alternatives,‚Äô does that mean ‚Äòstudents without alternatives in the LA area‚Äô or does that mean ‚Äòstudents who won‚Äôt have a place to live if they don‚Äôt get housing?‚Äô","We will have to see, I believe UCLA has more leeway as we are a month and half away from move-in day so a lot could change in these next few weeks, these schools had to make these decisions right now as they are approaching the beginning of fall semester, but like I said anything can happen",Yeahhhh I get what you‚Äôre saying but caltech also starts late September/ early October like us.

"Hey y'all, I'm taking Physics 1B this fall and I was hoping to get the textbook (**INCLUSIVE ACCESS - UNIV PHYSICS W/ MODERN PHYSICS & MODIFIED MASTERING by Young, 15th edition**) before classes start, but I can't seem to find it anywhere. It says it's unavailable, new or used, from the UCLA bookstore. I tried searching it up by title on amazon and ebay and abebooks and other sites, but I can only find versions that aren't ""inclusive access"" or ""with modified mastering"", and the textbook site doesn't have any pictures of the cover or table of contents or anything, so I don't really have any way to tell if these would be the same textbooks or not.

"I'm applying for disability accommodations through the CAE, and I know others have described quite negative experiences. In your experience, is the CAE actually helpful, or does it function more like a gatekeeping organization to block people from getting accommodations?  I also ask because the intake form has some sketchy questions.  There's all the usual questions related to one's disability, which are detailed but fine. Then there's a section that asks if you have:  * Other medical/mental health history * Substance use history * Legal history * Financial stressors * Social/family stressors  Chances are that, even if present, none of those things would relate to the initially described disability. I'm worried because it's a required question, and all those things are stigmatized and used to unfairly tarnish people's credibility.  I've had terrible experiences with accessibility centers before, so I'd appreciate any insight you have as to what this process (and this office) is like.","I think in this case the questions are intended to identify additional confounding factors that may exacerbate any disability-related difficulties; each thing identified there can make it that much more difficult to deal with a disability.  I've had great interaction with CAE.  But I've also had generally good albeit rather limited experience with accessibility departments.  I'm also a non-trad, so things may be different for me.  But the couple of times I've had ""emergency"" involvement with them, they've come through really quickly and been supportive.",my cae intake person was MORE sympathetic to me bc I explained how chaotic my home life is.,CAE was great for me and these question actually helped my counselor understand my situation better. They generally will try their best to get your accomdations(seriously my counselor got me a recording pen on top of  recording app which is not free just so i was able to get notes for class recorded)., CAE has been very helpful in my UCLA career. I am a current CAE student and they are very empathetic and understanding aswell as very helpful when it comes to helping students in need. Would love to chat with you and answer any questions you may have about the program :)!

"I tried to call the career center yesterday and I got to the part where I thought I might be able to talk to a career counselor, but then the phone just rang for like 5 minutes before it hung up.

LS7A was harder than biochem I feel like üò≠  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/icc41o),"LS 7A might be easier material-wise, but for the exams, CHEM 153A is MUCH more straight-forward (took it with Tienson). In 153A, what you put in equals your grade, but in LS 7A it's not lol.","Yes, this is how I feel. I felt like with ls7a I could have studied for hours but still done just as awful as if I didn't study for those exams. Whereas 153A was much more how much you put into the class.","I found Chem 153A to be a lot less straight-forward in its exams. The questions were rather vague and required very specific answers, and the very fact that it was free response made it more difficult. You had nothing to go off of when you encountered an unfamiliar question.  I thought LS 7A exams made a lot of sense and were less confusing compared to 7B. Plus, the exams were multiple choice. The LS core definitely tries to trick you with some of their responses, but at least if you're confident in your answer, you don't have to worry about whether you will lose points over not including some random term that was discussed during lecture.","Really? I have always felt free response exams are significantly easier than multiple choice.  Especially because there's no partial credit for multiple choice, you either know it or you don't.",For future reference put a results button for us who haven‚Äôt taken either or can‚Äôt decide,Sorry! will do next time

I wonder if there's any benefit to either since they seem to have the same deal going on. Im planning on purchasing a 13 inch MacBook pro if that makes any difference,"Hi - I work with the UCLA Store. The store has additional discounts (beyond Apple's education price) on some of the MacBook Pros, so you might want to check that out.  The store is not required to price the same as Apple! We're also discounting some of the Apple accessories that normally couldn't be discounted.  Reach out to the store at [compstore@asucla.ucla.edu](mailto:compstore@asucla.ucla.edu) or 310-825-6952 as we do have students and full-time staff available to chat with you.",does the store have extra discount for iPad Air?,Nothing beyond the everyday academic price.,It‚Äôll end up being the exact same from either. We‚Äôre required to price things the same as Apple,You get student store credit through ucla store though,"Ah true, a couple $5 off coupons. It‚Äôll definitely be much slower shipping probably though",I got mine from Best Buy when I entered college. It was $50 cheaper than the apple/UCLA pricing and I still got my free pair of beats headphones.,"About a month ago I bought the Ipad Pro through the UCLA Store website and I got free AirPods with it and shipping was free. It was a little cheaper than buying it off the apple store and I got my iPad within two days of placing the order, so the shipping was pretty quick!",I got mine from the Apple store because it was the same price but was able to be picked up so I could get it much faster :),Real talk I‚Äôd wait for the late 2020 MacBook unless you really need a computer right now,isn‚Äôt ucla having a deal where if you buy a macbook you could get air pods or something? if that‚Äôs still happening maybe buying from there would be better,Apple has the same deal for students. There‚Äôs really no difference at all between the two.,Student store has other discounts and you gain points toward next purchase though. Ucla store is better in this case
What are the new policies for research this quarter? Have any undergrads been able to get research positions if you didn‚Äôt have one already (especially those living at home)? Im curious how accessible research opportunities are atm,"Incoming grad student, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen. Labs are prioritizing grad student‚Äôs time, most labs are working either in scheduled shifts or with limited availability sign up sheets depending on lab capacity. Not very easy to get undergrads physically in the labs, however group meetings are all online now so if you‚Äôre interested in joining a group see if you can drop in on a few. Also computational groups are basically business as usual if you‚Äôre interested in that","I applied to one a month ago, they‚Äôre very scarce however there may be some labs still accepting undergrads for remote work. Keep your eye on the undergraduate research portal and try asking some profs/ta‚Äôs, they might know of some opportunities.","I am, but it‚Äôs data digitization so it‚Äôs stuff that can be done remote."
"I've been sent a post about an expose on the group and from what I read in the thread and commente, most of them are true.  I'm a girl who just experienced their first year with the group and although the group gets you outgoing I have experienced a handful of things.  1: I was told by guys to change my appearance since it suited me before. Basiclaly wanting me to be an ABG  2: girls use the guys for free stuff. Free drinks, food and in some cases free jewelery.  3:  The girls will get jealous quite easily and drama will start. The higher ups in the sorority know about the sexual abuse that goes on but they do nothing to deal with it as they see it will kill the mood.   4: cheating is promoted, sisters will promote it as a revenge tactic on their boyfriends. Several times the first years were encouraged to break up from their highschool sweet hearts or to cheat with them as ""college is a one time thing"" when i vented my relationship issues, my sisters suggested me to sleep with one of the frat boys to get back at him  5: the soc/frat hides the sexual harassment. If someone tries to get vocal they will be removed and their social group will stop contact. Situations like these happen rarely but there have been cases in the past.  6: You reveal your secrets and they can be held against you   7: You can get punished for bad behaviour and this means beint excluded from events. However parties the frat holds are known to randomly exclude peoppe even if they're nice.  8: racism exists, especially in the frat group. White guys are heavily discriminates.",It‚Äôs the same story over and over again with frats and sororities from all campuses. It‚Äôs beyond me why anybody would pay thousands to be a part of these groups to have a fake friend group that will out them at the drop of a hat for not conforming or for calling out their shit. People continue to come forward with stories like yours and it‚Äôs always sad and disgusting.,"Yep. Even in professional frats some of this behavior still persists. I know college is supposed to be a time of exploration and maturity but it's baffling how these experiences are reminiscent of shallow high school ""cliquey"" behavior and entitlement.",">	 I know college is supposed to be a time of exploration and maturity  Maturity comes with real life challenges, like getting a job and living by yourself. Getting wasted 24/7 and abusing girls is very far away from that.","It's because people *like* this shit.  They like being superficial and telling people how to change.  They like all of this drama with cheating in relationships and holding secrets over each others' heads.  This exists and persists because people ultimately like drama, judgement, etc.  That's why shows like The Bachelor and Real World are so popular.  Many people find it fucking crazy, but a lot of people also love it.","while true, you gloss over the cult aspect of this community. they isolate vulnerable people, show them a way to ""the golden truth"", then slowly indoctrinate them to believe everything that comes their way. it may have started that way, and a few might actually feel that way, but a large portion are just unfortunately caught at the wrong time and go too far to get out. then they just further cycle it","Sure.  It's obviously terrible, I'm just pointing out why people get convinced to do this.  It's not like a cult leads with telling you ""we're a cult.""  They demonstrate some value that might be beneficial (but is actually a lie).","well I can guarantee when I joined, most in my class was not like oh boy. drama and girls and alcohol. this will be just like Jersey shore. every single one in a class of 35 wanted something from the frat, with the small minority wanting the above, but most were decent, arguably great guys. but the frats changed them, as it did me","A lot of people don't just admit that they want that either.  The office gossips don't just say, ""Oh I love gossip and drama!""  In fact, many say the opposite.  People don't just admit to the bad things they want or like, but they still actively take part in it.","lmao you're saying I don't know the guys that I spent 30+ hours with. that knows my darkest secrets, and I knew theirs. that I could rely on them getting me home and away from the crazy actives. the ones that hurt themselves for my sake, and I did the same. but you're right. discount the fact that I've been trying to get attention to these facts and blame the victims on their own pitfalls","Lol what?  You seem to be missing my point.  ***People*** ***do*** ***like this, and other people don't.***  It persists because contrary to what you feel, others felt differently.  It's like why to many of us, having Trump as president is unimaginable, but he still has millions and millions who love him.  You seem really passionate about this, so my intention was never to discount your views and experience, it's to explain why this exists.  There are different perspectives, and what I am saying is that people don't think they are the bad guys or the cult or whatever.  A racist person likely doesn't believe they are racist, or won't outwardly say it.  A cult won't openly admit they are a cult.  Similarly, people who like drama don't admit they like drama all the time.  Does it mean everyone likes it?  No.  As indicated by you and your friends who you know don't, it's not a blanket statement.  But just because *you* didn't experience it, doesn't mean those people don't exist.  It's not like it's some system where everyone hates it but it magically persists.   I'm not victim blaming, because a lot of these people like this and don't view themselves at victims here.  But jesus, you got defensive real fast and gotta chill.",People are afraid of the idea of being alone,your thought completely sums up my thoughts thank you.,üíØ,Most frats and sororities are nothing like that,Crazy how people not even in Greek life will say you‚Äôre wrong when anyone actually invoked will agree.,"reddit just hates frats, but my experience was the opposite of this other than there being a lot of superficial relationships","Don't understand why everyone needs to make over generalizations.  Some frats are like this, some aren't.  Some members won't notice it because they are less involved than other members.  But of course this is reddit, which has it's own toxicity, so the majority of redditors will downvote anything that isn't blatantly anti-frat so they can generalize and add their own spin.","I‚Äôve never known much about sororities but this is heartbreaking. To the survivors and ex-Greek life members: please don‚Äôt give up. We‚Äôre here to support you. When you feel something has been said or done that is wrong please speak out, use your voice, and expose those in authority.

They‚Äôre paying for it,"by your logic everyone in an abusive relationship, in a cult, or toxic friendship deserve it","Wearing clown makeup is a joke, don‚Äôt compare it to an abusive relationship which involves a lot more emotions",you know why ppl stay in abusive relationships? because that's all they know. the relationship has isolated them from their entire support system. you think the problems that everyone has been outlining isn't doing the same? that they're trying to replace everyone's system with the frats/sororities themselves? so that leaving would mean losing their only friends/SOs from the system?,"Fraternities and sororities cultivate body image issues. Not only racist, but classists as well. Pretty toxic in my opinion. I know there are some students struggling to pay their tuition (including myself) and joining this will not be worth it. I suggest to find meaningful friends","More broadly, it seems like insecurity issues in general are often exacerbated (if not actively exploited) by Greek life. It's probably not an especially healthy environment for people with addictive tendencies, either. Unfortunately, most of those entering the system are fairly new to adulthood and may not be very aware of that side of themselves.","I‚Äôve never experienced this in Panhellenic, but I have heard some stories about Asian sororities like this... not sure how extreme or not it actually is","anyone who knows someone in one of the asian-interest frats/sororities, or even is familiar with them, would not be surprised at all.  it was mentioned in the last thread but it's so rough that speaking up against your frat/sorority, means also having to speak up against some of your ""brothers/sisters"" hence why so many people are so hesitant to speak up","I mean the fact that they are only for Asians is already a bad sign that there‚Äôs gonna be discrimination and peer pressure to be similar, otherwise they‚Äôd join a social frat/sor that is fine with people having differences. Never heard of problems like these in one of those.","Uh, what? You've never heard of problems like drama, sexual harassment, and racism in other social frats??","I‚Äôve never seen racism, and drama is just part of life. Sexual harassment is cases of some very disturbed individuals who probably wouldn‚Äôt even be bid by a respectable house. Also people say that Greek life tends to protect members who sexually assault women and I‚Äôve never seen that and can‚Äôt even imagine what kind of house would do that.","Just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. There are a lot of stories about frat parties where they try to get women drunk/drugged so they can take them upstairs.  As for racism, that kinda exists everywhere, but frats are basically the perfect place for that kind of group think, since members can choose who joins, ensuring they share their beliefs, [resulting in things like this.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2ye3a1/university_of_oklahoma_fraternity_sigma_alpha/)","No shit it happens but it happens everywhere, you go to any bar or club there‚Äôs shitheads buying girls drinks to try and get them drunk and hook up. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs something built into Greek life it just so happens that people get drunk at frat parties so it‚Äôs another place for those weirdos to do their thing.","I mean, I don't think the idea of having a club/group of people you can more easily relate to and understand their culture/upbringing is inherently a ""bad sign.""  Isn't that the point of rushing?  That you find people who you get along with and are often like minded or similar?","Yeah but if it‚Äôs a group basing it‚Äôs members not in similarity of personalities but in similarity or race hoping it will correlate with personality, they‚Äôre obvious gonna be surprised and irritated when the people they included because they assumed race=personality want to be different from the rest. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with those groups but I‚Äôm saying that the problems in the post are gonna be more prevalent in a group that wants to be more homogenous based on things like race than social Greek life which just wants people to get along.","But it's not saying or looking for race=personality.  It's about wanting to find a community that you can relate better to just culturally, given that many, many clubs are more Americanized.  Finding someone who has a similar home life, knows the foods you ate, knows the *specific* challenges you have are all important.  As someone who went into engineering, it was nice to have engineering groups who could vent and relate about engineering problems.  As an athlete, it was great to relate to other athletes and their struggles with injuries, coaches, etc.  This also applies to race/culture.  It's nice to talk about the challenges as a POC when you grow up in a place where you are literally a minority.",What do you propose be done about it to actually change any of this?,More people sharing their experiences will help others be more informed about what they're getting into if they decide to rush.,[deleted],Funny how you invalidate this person‚Äôs experience by writing them off as ‚Äúa salty white guy.‚Äù üôÑ,u/illegalsubletting took such a fat L in this thread that they literally deleted their whole account lol,Probably because they‚Äôre too high IQ to keep on arguing with ‚Äúsmoothbrains‚Äù and ‚Äúwastes of oxygen.‚Äù Now *that‚Äôs* what an ad hominem attack looks like!ü§ì,[deleted],"> Some people troll, pretend to be someone else, and argue in bad faith to prove their point, so this girl sharing her experience with Asian Greek life must actually be a salty white guy doing the same   Suit yourself.",[deleted],> What post? **Also how do we know this wasn't just posted by a salty white guy.**  And then you proceed to mention r/asablackman when I comment on you invalidating her experiences.  > I mean it's common enough that r/asablackman exists  I suggest you reread your comments :),[deleted],"Your intent was clear as day, my friend.

"Looking through the course requirements for med schools, it seems a lot of them require a semester (3+ units) of biochemistry.

"I am an incoming premed freshman and was wondering if a certain science (between physics, LS, and Chem) was recommended to start off with in the fall of freshman year. Is a certain one more suited for online instruction, etc. Also, apart from my pre-req science course, and a GE, what third class should I take? For reference I have already satisfied my W1 and math 31A and B from AP scores. Thanks :)","Out of the 3, LS is best online","You need a year of math as a premed so your AP credit doesn't do much. You'll either have to continue the math series at UCLA that is associated with your AP credit for 2 quarters and then take stats, or you can take the LS30 series plus stats. I'd recommend the latter as they are easy courses. I'd do LS30A plus your bio/chem and a GE. If you're confident, you could even add another GE/stem class but that is usually not recommend for your first quarter. I personally wish I didn't follow that advice but it is a risk to ignore it. As for which STEM course you take, how good it is online doesn't really matter since the entire year will be online likely so you'll take a lot of them online regardless. 7A or 14A, really doesn't matter. Pick the one you feel more comfortable with.","Note that you can take PIC courses to fulfill the math req, which may be more helpful to you than retaking calc!","I personally would start with the chem 14 series since there are a lot of chem classes that pre meds have to take, so it would be nice to get started earlier rather than later","I think most pre-med freshman are taking a (1) GE/cluster, (2) start of LS/Chem/Physics series, and a math class, which typically for premeds should be LS30A.","Very few people start with physics. I guess some people try to get physics over with as soon as possible, but it's definitely the least urgent of the three series to complete (like chem and LS are prereqs for a lot of courses, but the physics 5 series isn't).  Take a math class (LS 30A is recommended) and choose your poison between LS 7 and Chem 14A. The chem series is longer than the LS series. The LS 7 series is the most tedious series out of the three, so it'd be nice to get it over with online.   If you decide to go the non LS 30A series route, make sure you pick math classes that aren't too difficult, since GPA is pretty much everything for premeds. I'd recommend Math 32A, 33A, and Stats 13. You can also substitute PIC 10A for 33A, but PIC 10A isn't easy by any means if you haven't had any exposure to programming.",My biggest regret as a third year premed is not getting on Chem asap. You have to take a lot of chem courses as most med schools require extra labs and such,"Hi! So for your science GE's taking the LS series like LS7A and LS23L for example should satisfy those GE requirements.  I have been following the first page of this sheet that UCLA made to satisfy my pre-med requirements: [https://www.aap.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pre-Health-Requirements-092017.pdf](https://www.aap.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Pre-Health-Requirements-092017.pdf)  I wouldn't suggest starting the LS7 series so early your freshman year just because it is hard so maybe wait to take it winter quarter so you can get accustomed to college in general. However, the LS7 series you basically teach yourself the material, so that one would be best to take right now since classes are online.   And a lot of medical schools don't take AP scores so you're going to have to re-take your math courses again."
"Does anyone have or know where I can find a PDF of the textbook for 14a (Chemical Principles by Atkins 7th Edition). I checked on libgen but it only has until 6th edition.

You definitely don‚Äôt need the most up to date version, all the info is p much the same","Yeah \^ the 6th edition is fine. If you're taking lavelle, do the practice exercises because he takes some exam questions from them and otherwise does similar questions",Yeah I'm taking it with Lavelle. Does he not assign specific questions we have to complete or is anything we do out of the book completely voluntary?,He will give you a list of exercises to do on each topic and you'll pick 5 to turn in to your TA every week as HW.

Sorry I don't really know how the class works lol,"Textbook problems are almost always never turned in, except for a few professors. The answers are super easily found all over the internet which is why they aren't assigned.  The problems are literally the same in different versions just numbered differently.  For lower div and most upper div stem classes  it's honestly a waste of time and inefficient studying to read the textbook. The textbooks are usually only good for practice problems. Some professors also handout a whole bunch of old exams which are almost always better than the textbook as old exams are better representative of what exam questions will look like.","This is 100% not true for Lavelle‚Äôs Chem 14A. If you haven‚Äôt taken his class, please don‚Äôt make assumptions about it and potentially mislead people. @OP You absolutely need the textbook for this class ‚Äî turning in assigned hw problems is worth 10% of your grade, and every discussion section is spent almost entirely on reviewing the answers to hw problems assigned in the textbook.",Oh dang seems like the textbook is actually necessary then.

"I'm a new freshmen at UCLA for Economics major. I wanted to know a few things before this quarter starts, would love if someone could answer the following questions:  1. UCLA class sizes are huge so is it difficult to understand stuff?   2. How often do tests/quizzes happen? (I know they vary professor by professor but a general answer would be sufficient)  3. How difficult is it to maintain your GPA?   4. Whats the one thing you'll warn me about before starting at UCLA?   TIA","one thing i feel like nobody tells freshman is that GPA in college (esp UCLA) isn‚Äôt as straight-foward as high school. one thing i‚Äôve had to learn on my own (which was rough) is that there are some points where your resulting grade (and therefore, your GPA) will be completely out of your hands. you can do REALLY WELL on an exam and face a down curve. you can prepare as much as you want for an exam and then face things you weren‚Äôt ready for because it wasn‚Äôt taught OR the professor said to not worry about it (and, you should‚Äôve worried about it, because now it‚Äôs worth 12 points and is question 6). sometimes, it depends on the grading TA. your answer can be right but they won‚Äôt do anything about it because it‚Äôs not the rubric, word fornword.   GPA ‚Äòmaintence‚Äô isn‚Äôt something i think can directly be addressed because it depends on the situation. sometimes your failures are because of your own personal errors, and sometimes it‚Äôs because of things greater than you. focusing on my own growth + what i know has been helpful in breaking my attachment with GPA.   i don‚Äôt want you to think a bad GPA is therefore okay, because it isn‚Äôt. but in times where you bust your ass to no reward, just remember it can be due to something more than you","I personally didn't find it difficult to learn even with large class sizes. I actually found it kind of motivating that there were many other people going through the class with me at the same time and there would be many people to study with. Plus since most classes will be online this year, those large classes will just be on zoom. If you were worried about seeing the board or hearing in a large lecture this probably won't be as much of a problem. If you were concerned about getting personalized help, just go to TA office hours. Generally, classes have 1-2 midterms and a final and either regular (\~weekly) quizzes or graded hw.","I did econ. First few quarters were easy until I had to take 41, 101, and 103 - those times were pretty ass but still doable. There are people who enjoy it though. After the ""weeder classes"" I was able to take electives that for the most part interested me and were very manageable. I failed and had to retake 101 and tbh I'm the only person I know who did that but I turned out alright in the end. Also if you're somewhat considering possible careers in finance [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/hha8w3/graduates_especially_firstgens_what_do_you_wish/fw9atgc/) (and sub) is pretty helpful. It can probably be applied to most other career paths as well, try to get internships every summer/research experience if you're into that and it can help you figure out what you like and don't like. Imo job/internship recruiting 2nd year on > classes and grades","1. Depends. Size doesn't matter (I mean class size lmao) it depends on material. If you are a good self learner, you should be fine. Also depends on professor. 2. Usually 2-3 main tests (midterm 1, midterm 2, final) although there may be some quizzes that are substituted for hw. 3. Again depends on what courses you take, weeder courses harder (11,41), upper divs easier (the electives). 4. There will be many smart people that are unimaginably smart. Don't be discouraged. Believe in your abilities, put in the necessary work, and you will be fine. It's like a greys anatomy episode where one may not have natural ability, but if you keep practicing, you will be near the top.",It really depends on the degree. But many of my Econ buddies will complain about econometrics in particular.,Good luck bro - econ was tough  Edit: join a biz frat if you can. Tons of smart econ majors in there that helped me with coursework along with recruiting after I joined :-),"I feel like questions 1-3 have been answered pretty sufficiently by the other comments, but let me add on for your 4th point. I failed out of Econ at UCLA because I didn‚Äôt know about a department policy. Normally, UCLA College of Letters and Sciences has a rule where you can retake (if you received a C- or below) up to 2 classes for a full grade replacement. The Econ department has an additional couple rules. First, you need a C or higher to pass each prerequisite class. Second, you are only allowed to retake one lower division Econ class. Finally, receiving 2 Ds in lower division classes automatically makes you ineligible for declaring the major. I made the mistake of taking Econ 11 and Econ 41 in the same quarter while doing marching band, and I got 2 Ds. Immediately failed out of Econ with no chance for course correction. They don‚Äôt really have these rules posted anywhere so you should just be aware of it and take your major courses seriously. That being said, the class size and exam schedule aren‚Äôt really issues in my opinion, and I think if you are prepared and make good scheduling decisions, you can do very well.","Go to TA office hours if you're struggling with the material and aren't comfortable to ask your professor for help. For a lot of the large classes, professor office hours are fairly large, assuming the professor is halfway decent at explaining concepts, but TA office hours are really small (only 1-2 people, unless the TA is really popular for some reason).  Also use discussion forums like Piazza and Campuswire very regularly. Not sure how often Econ classes use them, but they're incredible resources."

"Which of these majors would be better in the future for jobs in data science/data analysis? Also, is it doable to finish math or computation in 4 years considering all of the required courses + GEs?","Is your primary interest in math, statistics, or CS? These majors have significant overlap; your choice should be based on your interests and the courses from the first year and a half you like the most.  * Math of Computation is mostly math with some CS. * Data Theory is balanced between math and stats. * The stats major provides a couple math courses as elective options. * The CS major includes a probability course, three technical breadth courses, and three sci-tech electives which can be used to study math and/or stats. * You always have the option to add a minor in math or stats (unless you're studying the corresponding major) and still graduate in four years.  None of these majors involve significant bio, chem, or physics, but the first three involve theoretical and proof-heavy coursework. Take Math 115A (linear algebra) as early as possible: it's the first upper-division math course most students take and serves as an introduction to proofs. I know data science is popular, but if you don't like upper-division math or intro programming, it might be wise to consider a different major or career path to avoid wasting time pursuing something you don't enjoy.","My primary interest is statistics, but I read more people do math of comp to have more exposure to programming and take upper-divisions to prepare for grad school.

Thanks for your help :‚Äô)))","There are other posts that do a good job at explaining the differences between the majors. Just look them up on this sub. Math of comp is possible to do in 4 years.

Of course it will help if you have some AP/transfer credit or if you can test out of foreign language. You can also just take classes over the summer.","As a person who isn‚Äôt a big fan of science (bio, chem, physics) and has little CS background, would it still be worth it to pursue a math of comp major? My math is decent, but I‚Äôm nervous about the difficulty of the science and CS courses.","If you don‚Äôt like math, don‚Äôt do math of comp. You aren‚Äôt going to enjoy it. The difficulty of the science (3) and CS (~6) courses isn‚Äôt bad especially since they are flexible in what classes you take, but that‚Äôs completely irrelevant if you just refer to math as ‚Äúdecent‚Äù. You‚Äôre gonna have to take ~18 math courses and they are more than just calculus. But as far as CS, your experience is completely up to you. You could take easier classes (PIC and easier CS UDs) and not learn as much, or you can take the challenging classes and try to learn what the CS majors know.","Hmm ok, thank you for your help! I‚Äôll probably use this summer and take a little bit of more pre-reqs to figure out what I want to do.","> has little CS background, would it still be worth it to pursue a math of comp major?   That depends... you want to be employ or not?  Programming as a skill have been growing as a basic requirement for many fields now.  I've met a person, coincidentally, named Karen. She and I was in the same grad program, statistic. She did not want to program at all. She asked me if it's really important. I told her that programming as a skill is growing in many field. She spent the next 40 minutes to convince me that it is not an essential skill.  When she graduated she couldn't get a job. You know what her next move?  To learn data science... because it is the hot thing. Apparently she knows some professor at UCLA that can let her audit it and stuff.  I asked her if she can hook me up with the materials. Hanged up and never talk to me again.  Anyway, I have no clue if she knew that data science require programming but yeah... I got a job though. Last I know she's got nothing but expensive student loan.",LOL yeah I definitely want to be employed. I will probably begin learning how to program then and see what I‚Äôll do. Thank you for your help!,"If you are nervous about science courses, maybe don‚Äôt do a major that includes those. The science courses really aren‚Äôt easy here, and even the science courses tailored towards the life science majors (these science courses are technically easier), have a crap ton of gunner pre meds in there. I definitely considered that, as I was premed before I switched to stats/econ. Also maybe you like math but don‚Äôt like applied math, like chem or physics or whatever. I know I sure don‚Äôt like science but I can do math...my boyfriend is the opposite lol. So choose what suits you.  And if you‚Äôre trying to do data science, maybe consider data theory major? But statistics is pretty much where you want to go in general for data science.  Also, because math of comp probably won‚Äôt teach you the coding languages you need for stats/data science, but will teach you coding for programming. Also like other commentators have said, coding is very important! For the rest of summer, you can try to take a simple online coding class (in a data science related language like R, Python, or SQL and see if you like). Dm or reply if you have any more questions!","Your best bet is Math of Comp but fill all your required electives with Stats classes, although it might be hard to get  those classes since the dept. prioritizes Stats students.  The biggest weakness of pure Statistics students when it comes to data science is often the lack of Computer Science foundation. I know that‚Äôs mine. It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt learn it on your own, but a formal academic training is always helpful.  I know someone who double-majored in both and said that CS 33 has been the most useful class he has taken.",Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm worried about in terms of pursuing a major in stats is that I won‚Äôt be as prepared in CS experience compared to everyone else. But thank you for your response!!,"While CS knowledge is important, depending on your career goals, I would say knowing the internal details of computer architecture, C++ and what not is beyond the scope of stats and data science. Algorithms (Math 180) and data structures are probably more important. I did BE at UCLA and Biostat in grad school elsewhere but the interview I bombed was basically related to that stuff since we never covered it. I didn‚Äôt know Python well and mostly knew R at the time but didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúreal‚Äù programming knowledge, just numerical computing. So even things like ‚Äúadd up the digits of an integer‚Äù were hard.  Nowadays data engineering is coming up as a field though and things like memory management and production details will be stuff they handle.   Packages like Tensorflow/Keras are becoming more statistical in nature to use rather than CSey. But a stat focused job generally requires grad school.  Sidenote is I wish the engineering department at UCLA didn‚Äôt focus on matlab since that was yet another weakness I had since I never formally learned Python."

"Hello all, I am gonna be a senior next year. I want to apply to the ucla school of engineering. I am curious how tough it is? I go to a pretty low income high school in the la area, so the academics aren‚Äôt the hardest ngl idk if that matters or not. I am in the top 4 percent of my class for the uc gpa and my combined uc gpa is 4.35. I am an Eagle Scout, 120+ hours of volunteering, President of a gaming club and worked 20 hours a week at a restaurant during the school year. I didn‚Äôt take the sats yet  I am just curious if I have a decent shot at coming here.  Main reason why I made this post is because my friend who was the valedictorian of class of 2020 got rejected by engineering with a 35 on the act.",Not an enginnering student and only an incoming freshman but you miss all the shots you don‚Äôt take. Your friend‚Äôs rejection shouldnt stop you from applying. I had a way less impressive stats and ECs than you but I applied anyway and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful that I did.,"That‚Äôs right!!! Congrats though, I bet u felt great when u saw that u got accepted :) I am just having second thoughts cuz like ppl are saying engineering is extremely competitive","It is competitive for sure, it brings out the best in you. Some days are discouraging but trust me, there are plenty of rewarding days. Good luck if you decide to apply!","Thank you, I guess I will worst case senario I get rejected which is parta life","admissions are unpredictable and nothing that any of us say here would ultimately be a make or break for your own decision. if you really want to come here, it‚Äôs worth a shot!! you never know. your stats are definitely strong - cases like your friend do happen, but i think it‚Äôs worth applying for sure",Yeah I will just take the chances and hope for the best!,"Yeah like the other user said, admissions are a bit unpredictable, but your stats are pretty good in my opinion. Being from California also helps.",Alr let‚Äôs hope for the best.,"Correct me if I'm mistaken, but I believe HSSEAS admits by major? So your chances would be lower regardless of how good or bad your stats were if you apply CS compared to some of the other majors. In the end, it's like 8% v. 14%, so pretty marginal.","You definitely have a good shot based on your stats and extracurriculars, but keep in mind that nothing is guaranteed. I was rejected from UCB and UCSD and got in here, a result I could not have predicted. Engineering applicants are evaluated relative to others applying to the same major, so departments with a higher applicant-to-capacity ratio (such as CS and mechanical/aerospace) are more competitive. If you're not set on a particular field yet, being flexible with your major and looking at statistics may improve your chances of getting in. My advice is to apply to all of the top UCs and focus on writing good essays. Only write about the two or three extracurriculars for which you have the most passion; there isn't enough space in your essays to write about all of them.","Once you‚Äôre in seas, as long as you maintain B avg, you can easily switch majors within seas. So you might consider applying to matsci and then switching to cs or something"
This is my first apartment and I‚Äôm super excited to find out about what life is like!

Hi guys  I just wanted to ask if I can take the MDT after the due date (which was July 15). I didn‚Äôt take it cuz I wasn't planning to take math class this fall until a few days ago..,Just take it lol. There are people who take placement tests during orientation.
Title basically. Need a place to park for a few days and wondering what the availability of street parking is and if anyone has any recommendations,LADOT is not enforcing street sweeping or the 72-hr rule during the COVID-19 pandemic. Open spots vary by street but you should be able to find a spot somewhere on the west side if you‚Äôre not choosy. DO watch out for temporary no parking/tow-away restrictions however; those and curbs are strictly enforced and the tickets aren‚Äôt cheap.,"Don‚Äôt have specific recommendations, but there have been tons of free empty spots whenever I drive around!",It's fairly available these days since most students are gone.  Watch out for street sweeping days.,You‚Äôll be fine as long as your car doesn‚Äôt need to be parked on both Thursday and Friday mornings. Street cleaning tickets were like $73 in 2019.
"I want to buy a UCLA sweatshirt and t-shirt, so I'm wondering when the best time is to buy merch because I've heard that there are sometimes sales on the UCLA store? Also, is there anywhere I can buy UCLA merch for cheaper, or is the UCLA store the best way to go?",[deleted],where is the campus store in Westwood located?,at westwood and le conte. across the street from the chick-fil-a,thank u:-),"There is a sale at the beginning of the year, think its like 20% off. But like someone else said, the store in Westwood is cheaper and has basically the same stuff",costco is a good place to shop. if you live in LA you‚Äôll most likely see some ucla gear. i got a cool UCLA jacket from there,Depop has a few cute ones for cheap,The thrift stores around here are a good bet.,I got my hoodie on clearance for $10 at TJ Maxx,The on-campus store usually offers 20% sales once or twice per quarter. You can also buy merch elsewhere in Westwood or at various online stores.,Target also has UCLA gear!,"I bought some at Target and some at Depop! Target has like the basic gear that you'll need to survive a game or rally but Depop, I found has cuter vintage stuff :)"

Anyone know what this means? It‚Äôs for fall quarter.,It means that you can watch prerecorded lectures at whatever time you'd like. Discussions may be live though depending on the class.,Oh lit thank you!
"Anyone knows where I can obtain a copy of Elman's textbook? It seems like ucla bookstore is the only place that sells the book, but it's apparently out of stock right now.","Which textbook is it? Hoffman and Kunze can be found in PDF form online. For Friedberg, Insel, Spence, the PDF for the 5th edition is difficult to find but the 4th edition is out there, which has basically the same content but different exercise numbers. There's a separate PDF you can find for the exercises in the 5th edition.  However, my favorite linear algebra textbook by far is Axler's Linear Algebra Done Right. I found the proofs much clearer than either of the two above so I highly recommend reading it alongside the class, even if the class is not based on the book.  Not sure about physical copies.

Thanks for your recommendation. I will definitely look more into those books.,"Ah, I didn't know Elman wrote his own book. He'll probably say something about it then when the class actually starts, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.","You‚Äôll probably get a PDF if it‚Äôs his actual book, but I took 115AH with Gieseker in the spring and it seems like the norm is using Hoffman-Kunze Linear Algebra, it‚Äôs the gold standard for linear algebra so probably more helpful than Elman‚Äôs write up. There are PDFs all over the web as well.","Yeah, seems like I have to email him in advance to get the pdf version of his book if I want to prep for the class. And also thank you for recommending Hoffman-Kunze."
"To make sure I ain't doing something illegal, if I registered to vote sometime last year through a student organization (with my UCLA address) but now live at home, there is no way to change my registered address right? So I would just register again from scratch to update my address? Thanks :)"," https://registertovote.ca.gov/ When you re-register the form will ask if you were registered at another address.  You put that (old) address in there and your registration will be updated.  If you want to stay registered and vote at your UCLA address (as you don't intend to live at home permanently) you can have an absentee ballot to wherever you are living now, but get to vote on offices and ballot initiatives that affect Westwood.  EDIT:  Looks like the SOS website is down today so just update your info tomorrow.",The process to register and update your address is the same. Realistically the only way you'll do something illegal is if you actually vote twice in the same election.
"For those of you who have submitted a CAR this summer for fall housing, how long has it taken housing to get back to you? I submitted one last week and I'm trying to figure out what the realistic timeline could be like just because it will influence my roommate search.

"Is he a good professor to take during remote instructions? Are the midterm(s), and final fair? Thanks!","I‚Äôve had Killip for 33a. Most likely he would prerecord all his videos and post them on CCLE. He has a British accent (I think it‚Äôs British?) also not necessarily the worst Professor I had, but ngl he kinda put me to sleep. But also I found 33a to be harder than 32b so do what you will with that information.   Midterms, if I remember correctly were worth 10%, I also had a quiz every week.  Just expect to understand math conceptually. He has many conceptual problems on the midterms/final.",Thanks! 10% midterms... wow. Were the quizzes timed?,"Yeah, midterms were worth 10% each! Quizzes were worth 20% total! I forgot how much homework was worth, but be expected to turn hw in on gradescope as well.   Quizzes were timed at 15 min in the beginning of the quarter, but I think Killip thought we all did poorly so he extended the quizzes to either 20 or 30 min which I think depended on the material on the quiz.   I just think if you wanna take Killip, be prepared to try and understand math conceptually!  Also during his regular scheduled class time on MWF, he would host a zoom session where u can ask him questionsssssss. He‚Äôs nice tho.","Awesome, thanks for the heads up!","Agreed on all counts. I stopped watching the dude's lectures around week 2 because I had a god-tier TA who, frankly, taught just as well (if not better) in a third of the time.  FWIW, I also felt 33A was somehow harder than 32B in spite of all I've heard to the contrary, likely because of Kilip's greater emphasis on proof writing/conceptual understanding."

If campus reopens, it is not even sure they will international students in right away... Do you already have a visa?  In any case, according to my experience looking for housing, it depends a lot on what you are looking for (roommate, distance, budget...) but you should be able to find something in not too long so I wouldn't worry too much (I found a place within a week when I first got here - pre covid though :/).","I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have too much of a problem having housing for winter in LA, as long as you‚Äôre okay with not necessarily living in Westwood, though finding a place in Westwood is probably still possible since half of people are staying home for the fall","I would say that it is likely that you would be able to find a place whenever they open up. If you don't get housing with ucla, you could probably find some off campus housing. Also, I would not bet on campus opening completely in the winter, though I definitely hope it will be able to."
"I know I'll be downvoted but this has to be said. A lot of unsubstantiated claims against greek life are often upvoted and circlejerked around here. It's gotten pretty annoying and sad, especially with the asian greek life  expos√© recently. I'm not in an asian org, but I am in a frat but I can attest to the constant hate that frats/sororities get on reddit. My house has experienced it first hand.  I don't why people on here salivate at drama when it comes to frats or why they hold such bitterness towards them, but it's honest pathetic at this point. The truth is that the people who frequent this sub the most are very biased against greek life. It just isn't their thing and they go out of their way to demean it. Reddit is more saturated with people who aren't as social and don't like to go out as much. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing inherently wrong with that, and if that's your thing, then cool. But for the worst offenders, please don't use your anonymity as an invitation to bash orgs on campus simply because you resent or are envious of them. If you didn't fit in with that crowd, either now or in high school or both, then that's fine. Just keep it moving and don't start all kinds of crazy stupid rumors to try to ""get back"" at the cool kids for excluding you or whatever weird thing you got going on in your head.  The truth is that MOST greek life orgs are NOTHING like this sub paints them. The majority of orgs hold no resemblance to any of the shit that is constantly spewed on here by bitter people who probably didn't get a bid or those who want to start drama. I advise everyone else, most of you that is, who don't fall in this camp to be wary of the things that are posted on here by all these random throwaways. They're using this is an opportunity to get revenge or troll.   If you ask people in greek life about their experiences, 8 or 9 out of 10 will tell your overwhelmingly positive things. For the others, greek life is perhaps not for them. But for a vast majority of us we enjoy it and like how things are.   r/UCLA tends to exaggerate and make crazy claims with no evidence and people eat it up at face value without stopping to think critically about any agenda there may be. I would advise everyone to take these posts with a grain of salt.   I would also advise those  mischievous few who are behind this propaganda to get a life and leave greek life alone. I know you weren't the most popular people in high school or even now, and hated that the popular future ""frat kids"" were always having a blast, but don't let that bleed into your UCLA experience. Instead, do something productive. Study for your chem final or something. Focus on your hobbies and interests. Get a freaking life. Get laid, idk do something other than focus all your attention on something you could never fit in to.  /rant","I shit on frats a lot, but to be honest, IFC and Panhellenic are improving. They have a lot of rules that houses have been following more recently, and even though there's a long way to go, there's a clear desire to fix the issues Greek Life has, at least based on what I've seen at the IFC meetings I've attended.  But attacking r/UCLA for not providing legal documents or whatever backing up their personal experiences with Greek life is fucking stupid. You also spent most of this post saying ""You're not popular/cool, so get a life and stop stating your opinions on this."" Most people here have directly interacted with Greek Life and developed their negative beliefs about people in those organizations through personal experience. All you're doing here is proving that the anti-Greek sentiment on r/UCLA is correct, and that people involved with frats are cocky assholes.  Stop making us look bad.",Exactly. I had a suitemate freshman year who joined a sorority and would always have people over late at night. The other roommate and I would just stay in our room because we couldn‚Äôt even relax in a shared space we were paying thousands of dollars for. I even had one of my video games stolen coincidentally after a little get together with her frat boyfriend and his friends.,"Well said. Obviously not all frat boys/sorority girls are the same, but my old roommate was part of Greek life here, and she made it all seem really shallow by constantly talking about the stereotypes assigned to different frats and obsessing over how highly each one was ranked or whatever.","Almost none of my IFC friends have mentioned rankings, ever. We're mostly friendly between frats, but I've heard sororities get competitive.  One guy in Phi Delta Theta, he seemed to care about GreekRank. I haven't seen any others.",My old roommate gave me the impression that the more popular sororities only hung out with the more popular fraternities. But I'm starting to think a lot of that was just her own shallow worldview.,"Maybe don‚Äôt take a page from u/illegalsubletting, because using all these ad hominem attacks doesn‚Äôt help your point.  Nobody here is jealous of Greek life.

"Like the title says, I have my NSO next Monday but I‚Äôm trying to make a class planner and have some backup courses as well. I‚Äôm a poli sci major and I‚Äôve been advised before that since my major doesn‚Äôt require a lot of upper-division units, I should think about declaring a minor. I‚Äôm interested in public affairs but don‚Äôt know exactly how to plan out my classes. Should I focus on my minor later? I was first thinking of taking all poli sci classes this semester but if I‚Äôm going to declare a minor figured I could look up some PA courses as well. Will I be able to enroll in any courses unrelated to poli sci? I read that I need to have taken some classes at UCLA before I‚Äôm able to declare a minor, is that true? And when would I take PA courses, before or after I declare it as my minor? Advice would be great, thank you!","During your orientation you‚Äôll have to enroll in two major classes and one elective outside of your major. If there are spots open and it doesn‚Äôt have restrictions like only majors/minors can enroll at that time or a prerequisite you haven‚Äôt met, you should be able to enroll in a public affairs class.  Declaring a minor depends. Some you need to apply to. Some you need to pass a specific class. Some you can just declare.   This is what I could find on it. It breaks what you need to declare/complete the minor:  https://luskin.ucla.edu/undergraduate-program/minors","Very helpful, thank you!","I don't know the specifics for public affairs courses, but a general tip for you: space permitting, you may get opportunities to enroll in some courses that are normally restricted by major or prerequisite. Your chances of getting to do this are better if a professor in the department (ideally, the one teaching the class you want) knows who you are and has a positive impression of you. If you do this within your own department, you may even be offered to have the class count against a degree requirement.  This isn't something you can do right away, obviously. Stick to stuff you can enroll in normally and make friends with your professors. Later on, when you find yourself wanting to take one of these restricted classes, you can ask for a PTE (""permission to enroll"") number.","Thank you!! After reading about PA, I was actually interested in double-majoring but was unsure whether if I could graduate on time or not. If I enjoy the classes, I think I‚Äôll just keep taking as many lower division courses as I can and see how it plays out. I was going to ask my counselor about it too. But thanks again for the insight, I was actually wondering whether or not you can petition classes as subs for your major cause I feel like Poli Sci and PA are pretty similar so I‚Äôm sure it wouldn‚Äôt be unheard of.","FWIW, I actually was also a transfer student, started off taking Russian as an elective, changed majors after a year, and still graduated on time. Depending on what you‚Äôd need to graduate and when the courses are offered, you might have to do some courses in the summer or have a few quarters with busy schedules later, but it‚Äôs not impossible.","Just chiming in to add that you should speak to both departments - there are Public Affairs classes that have been approved for the PoliSci major and vice versa, so you can double dip."

i swear it‚Äôs broken or somethin,"Welcome to SoCal.  Late summer (August, but especially late September) are the hottest times of the year.   This heat wave is a little early, but not substantially.  Fun fact: we call them the ""dog days of summer"" because the ancient Greeks and Romans saw Sirius (the ""dog star"") appear in the sky and thought it caused the extra heat (as well as other unpleasantness).",I wish i was down in Westwood... supposed to be a record 115 degrees at my place in sac next week,Did you see the lightning yesterday?,"Yeah it was crazy, it kept hitting right on top of us... we got hot rain dumped on us for a few minutes too",[deleted],"Surely orange man is not as bad as you purport him to be?

So I am moving into an apartment and starting utilities. But do we set the account up so the service starts the day we move in or so it starts before we get there?,"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, you can just call SoCal Gas & LADWP, tell them the day you‚Äôre moving in and then they‚Äôll just start charging you from that date. I did it a little later but I told them the exact date we moved in so they just backtracked and charged the couple days before then.","Setting up LADWP (power/water) is easy. Just go to their website and submit a request to ‚Äústart new service.‚Äù You will select a date to start service, so you can just set it up for that day (so long as if its a weekday as they only start service Mon-Fri).","I'd get them going on the date you're officially allowed to move in, or the first weekday prior (so, if your move-in is a Saturday, have them turned on Friday).  There isn't really any extra charge for the few days one way or the other (since they're based on usage, if no one's there using them, there's only some minimal monthly charges), and having power and water and gas when you're moving is nice."
"I‚Äôm considering doing a masters but I‚Äôm not sure how financial aid and graduate school work. The masters would just take one year, but does fafsa help at all with that or does it solely depend on school grants ??","If you're considering doing one in the US (which I assume you are) then you'd have to check schools individually to see what kind of aid they offer and what they say about grants, loans, etc. But yes, taking out loans for grad school is a thing people do, sadly.","Masters programs are notorious for not giving any funding/financial aid. After all, they tend to be the income programs use to pay the PhDs.   The FAFSA mostly helps you qualify for student loans which you take out to pay for tuition, books, living expenses, etc. it‚Äôs better than taking out a personal loan because the interest rates are lower.","It really varies on the school/program. My sis is going to a CSU and was offered mostly grants, maybe 3-4 k in loans/year."
"Hi,  I'm currently stuck choosing between math of computation and statistics. I considered double majoring but I realized this might be difficult. Can any alumni/current students provide insight in the pros and cons between professors and staff in both departments? How are the job prospects and internships while majoring in stats or math of comp?    For those double majoring in these subjects, is it doable/completable with good grades in four years?   Thank you","Not alumni at UCLA but I lurk here since I work nearby as a statistician.  I have a BS in CS at UCR and a master in applied statistic at CSULB.  I can tell you the statistic side of things.  It's a hot field that many other field uses (biostatistic, data science, actuary, econometric, political science, forestry, etc...).   For biostatistic, you can go clinical side of things or MPH (public health) like Anthony Fauci which uses data to suggest health mandate (wearing masks).   As for internship, for federal internship there is a website https://www.zintellect.com/ you can intern at FDA or NASA like I did. JPL have their own website because of their special status.  I think UCLA program is pure statistic, UCR is applied statistic. The difference is how deep in theory versus applied.  I know a few math friends and it seems they have a harder time finding a job compare to statistic; the future may change depending on saturation of job market. I think the rigor in statistic makes this field much more rare (compare to data science). Which have its pros and cons. Do keep in mind I personally don't know what computational math entails.   This is from the perspective of master. I'm not entirely sure about bachelor, I don't think it's enough to get a job with a bachelor for statistic.","Stats faculty here. Both are great majors. You can't go wrong with either.  As many other suggested, you can major in one and minor in the other. I have taught many students who are Stats major with Math minor and many students who are Math majors with Stats minor (anecdotally Applied Math and Math of Computation are the most common majors I've encountered.) Certainly doable within four years.  The Stats department is small and the first pass of enrollment is reserved for students majoring in statistics to ensure these students can enroll in the classes they need for graduation. After the first pass is over, the second pass opens up for students minoring in statistics. If you minor instead of major in statistics, it's possible to have some bad luck with enrollment and not get into the class you need (with the professor you want) to complete the minor. It might be wise to ""budget"" one summer to take summer classes to fill the class requirements, but that does mean sacrificing a summer that could be spent in an internship. (The stats department is working hard to hire new lecturers and professors to offer more sections and classes. However, some students seem to be afraid to take classes from new professors and we end up with classes that aren't full.)  I also want to promote the Data Theory major as a new major that has been developed as a joint venture between the mathematics and statistics departments. It is similar to a major/minor between the departments. It has a strong emphasis on theoretic math (as the name suggests) and also on statistics and coding.  I'm happy to answer any additional questions you might have.","not op, but i have a few questions i'd be thrilled if you could answer: 1. how feasible is it to double major with math of comp/applied math and stats? the 5 course overlap restriction makes this seem pretty difficult  2. for someone who's interested in data science but not sold on it yet, do you think it's preferable to major in data theory or a math/stats combo of some sort?  thank you sm professor chen!!","I‚Äôm currently a mathematics of computation major. I only just finished my first year so I can‚Äôt provide insight into job prospects and what not, but I will say that the math of comp major allows you to take stats courses to fulfill the 6 upper division math electives requirement. This is one of the main reasons I chose this major after being in a similar situation. I feel that the math of comp major allows for solid exposure in math, cs, and stats that will prepare you well for a number of grad programs.","hello, former stats major and current math major so I will try to help!  Double majoring is possible (although the most common combo is applied math and stats) and has its advantages; for one, the stats department is very small and will restrict stats classes to stats majors on the first pass, so it's significantly easier to get into stats classes as a stats major. I honestly don't know how much you get out of double majoring bc like a previous commenter said, you can just take a lot of stats classes as a math major (because there's a lot of overlap between math and stats) and have them fulfill degree requirements. You can take as many stats classes as you like throughout your time at UCLA and just go to town, really. Note that the math department will let you take \*any\* stats class to fulfill elective requirements but only a certain subset of math classes will count for the stats degree elective requirements.  I do want to emphasize though: how desirable you are to employers depends on many factors, and choice of major is usually not a large one because for a lot of jobs there are lots of fields of study that will give you the background and skills needed to be successful. You can go into data science as a math of comp major (or pretty much any math major, really); you can also do that with a stats degree. The same is true if you wanted to do consulting, business analytics, marketing analytics, ML, data engineering, finance, etc.   That being said, transitioning to a more CS heavy role is easier as a math of comp major than a stats major, if that matters to you.","Just as a suggestion, it‚Äôs possible to major in math of comp and minor in stats. But if you don‚Äôt wanna do that, you can take stats upper division classes as a substitute for some math upper divs.  There are other posts on this sub about the differences between the majors.","Omg you should minor in stats so you get the best of both worlds because that is what I would do if I were you.  Cs knowledge is very useful now, and tbh, I rather have coding knowledge for programming than coding knowledge for data cleaning/stats related stuff."

Hey i came into ucla thinking i wouldn‚Äôt rush fall quarter cause i wanted some time to get used to the campus and would just rush winter/spring. That didnt end up working out and with corona I have no clue how fall rush is gonna be. Does anyone have any clue of what we should do if we want to rush as a sophomore?
